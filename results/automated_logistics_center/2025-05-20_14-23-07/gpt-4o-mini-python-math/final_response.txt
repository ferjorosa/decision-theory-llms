Let's summarize the calculations and information derived for the decision problem regarding the logistics center automation:

### 1. Expected Utility Calculation Without Testing

#### Advanced Robotics System
- **Probabilities:**
  - Probability of smooth operation: \(P(\text{Smooth}) = 0.70\)
  - Probability of minor failure: \(P(\text{Minor}) = 0.20\)
  - Probability of major failure: \(P(\text{Major}) = 0.10\)

- **Utilities:**
  - Smooth operation (utility): 150
  - Minor failure (utility): -40
  - Major failure (utility): -120

- **Expected Utility:**
\[
EU_{\text{Advanced without Test}} = (0.70 \cdot 150) + (0.20 \cdot -40) + (0.10 \cdot -120) = 85.0
\]

#### Conventional Robotics System
- **Probabilities:**
  - Probability of smooth operation: \(P(\text{Smooth}) = 0.95\)
  - Probability of failure: \(P(\text{Failure}) = 0.05\)

- **Utilities:**
  - Smooth operation (utility): 60
  - Failure (utility): -30

- **Expected Utility:**
\[
EU_{\text{Conventional without Test}} = (0.95 \cdot 60) + (0.05 \cdot -30) = 55.5
\]

### 2. Summary of Expected Utilities without Testing

- **Expected Utility for Advanced Robotics System:** 85.0
- **Expected Utility for Conventional Robotics System:** 55.5

### 3. Expected Utility Calculations With Feasibility Test

The feasibility test costs â‚¬10M. The posterior probabilities (after assuming the test results) will influence the utility assessments as follows:

#### Outcome Probabilities after the Test

1. **For Excellent (e):**
   - Pr(Smooth) remains high leading to a utility of:
   \[
   EU_{\text{Advanced, Excellent}} = 140 - 10 = 130
   \]
   
2. **For Good (g):**
   - Calculated probabilities show expected utilities for the good result as:
   \[
   EU_{\text{Advanced, Good}} = 140 - 10 = 130
   \]

3. **For Bad (b):**
   - In this case, the outcome utility will yield a significant loss:
   \[
   EU_{\text{Advanced, Bad}} = -50 - 10 = -60 
   \]

### Final Assessment with Test

- **Summary of Expected Utilities With Test (given the outcomes):**
  - **Excellent:** Expected utility = 130
  - **Good:** Expected utility = 130
  - **Bad:** Expected utility = -60

Given the probabilities and outcomes from the test, and expected utilities derived from that, it can be seen:

### Conclusion and Recommendation

1. **Without the test**, selecting the **Advanced Robotics System** yields an **expected utility of 85.0**.
2. **With the test**, though the decision could yield higher utilities depending on the results (130 for excellent and good), there is still a significant risk of loss from a bad outcome (-60).

Given the higher expected utility without testing and the nature of investment risk involved, the rational decision is:

**Recommendation: Choose the Advanced Robotics System Without Conducting the Feasibility Test.**

This maximizes expected utility, leveraging the higher return potential from upgrading to automated systems while avoiding the potential sunk cost in testing with uncertain outcomes.
