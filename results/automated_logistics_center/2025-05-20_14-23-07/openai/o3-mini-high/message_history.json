The company has three strategic options:\n\n1. **Conventional Robotics System**: This offers moderate automation and proven reliability.\n2. **Advanced Robotics System**: This system is highly automated and AI-powered, but it carries greater technical risk.\n3. **Do Nothing**: The current logistics system is retained with no investment.\n\n### Optional Feasibility Test\n\nBefore committing to the advanced system, the company may choose to conduct a feasibility test on critical system components. The test costs €10 million and yields one of three results: **bad (b)**, **good (g)**, or **excellent (e)**.\n\nThe test outcome depends on the true performance category of the advanced system:\n\n- If the system is fully functional (smooth):\n  - Probability of a good result: 0.20\n  - Probability of an excellent result: 0.80\n\n- If the system is prone to minor failures:\n  - Probability of a bad result: 0.30\n  - Probability of a good result: 0.55\n  - Probability of an excellent result: 0.15\n\n- If the system is prone to major failures:\n  - Probability of a bad result: 0.40\n  - Probability of a good result: 0.40\n  - Probability of an excellent result: 0.20\n\n### Prior Probabilities\n\nFor the **advanced system**, the prior probabilities for each possible state are as follows:\n\n- Smooth operation: 0.70\n- Minor failure: 0.20\n- Major failure: 0.10\n\nFor the **conventional system**, the prior probabilities are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 0.95\n- Failure: 0.05\n\n### Outcome Utilities\n\nUtility is expressed in millions of euros and reflects the net value of each scenario.\n\n#### Utility Notation\n\n- **T**: Testing strategy (either `test`, `no test`, or `do nothing`)\n- **I**: Investment decision (`advanced` or `conventional`)\n- **A**: Outcome for the advanced system (`smooth`, `minor failure`, or `major failure`)\n- **C**: Outcome for the conventional system (`smooth` or `failure`)\n- **U**: Utility in € million\n\n#### Utility Values\n\nIf the company **conducts the test** and then selects the **advanced system**, the utility values (after subtracting the €10M test cost) are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 140\n- Minor failure: -50\n- Major failure: -130\n\nIf the company **conducts the test** and then selects the **conventional system**, the utility values are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 50\n- Failure: -40\n\nIf the company **does not conduct the test** and chooses the **advanced system**, the utility values are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 150\n- Minor failure: -40\n- Major failure: -120\n\nIf the company **does not conduct the test** and chooses the **conventional system**, the utility values are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 60\n- Failure: -30\n\n### Decision Sequence\n\nThe company follows this decision sequence:\n\n1. Choose whether to conduct the feasibility test.\n2. If the test is conducted, observe the test result (bad, good, or excellent).\n3. Update beliefs (posterior probabilities) based on the test result.\n4. Choose the investment strategy that maximizes expected utility.\n\n\n## Objective\n\nGiven the problem description above, your task is to identify the rational decision(s) at each point in the process. Use the information provided to evaluate the options and explain your reasoning clearly. Return your final recommendation based on sound analysis.\n"

    "content": "Below is a step‐by‐step analysis showing how to compare the alternatives and arrive at the optimal decision:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. No‐Test Analysis\n\nIf the company forgoes testing, it can choose between:\n• Advanced Robotics System (with prior outcomes specified)\n• Conventional Robotics System\n\nFor the advanced system (no test), the outcomes (in millions of euros) are:\n – Smooth: 150  \n – Minor failure: –40  \n – Major failure: –120\n\nUsing the given prior probabilities for the advanced system (smooth = 0.70, minor = 0.20, major = 0.10), the expected utility is calculated as follows:\n\n EU(advanced, no test) = 0.70×150 + 0.20×(–40) + 0.10×(–120)\n                 = 105 – 8 – 12 = 85\n\nFor the conventional system (no test), the outcomes are:\n – Smooth: 60  \n – Failure: –30  \nwith probabilities (smooth = 0.95, failure = 0.05). Therefore:\n\n EU(conventional, no test) = 0.95×60 + 0.05×(–30)\n                 = 57 – 1.5 = 55.5\n\nThus, without testing the best option would be the advanced system with EU = 85 (and “do nothing” is not quantified but is naturally inferior to making an upgrade).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Test‐Based Analysis\n\nThe company may conduct a feasibility test at a cost of €10 million. Importantly, the utilities provided after testing already include this sunk cost. In the test branch the decision maker will observe one of three outcomes: bad (b), good (g), or excellent (e). The probabilities of these outcomes depend on the true state of the advanced system. The prior probabilities for the advanced system are:\n • Smooth: 0.70  \n • Minor failure: 0.20  \n • Major failure: 0.10\n\nThe test result probabilities conditional on the state are given as:\n\n For a smooth system:\n  P(b) = 0  P(g) = 0.20  P(e) = 0.80\n For a system with minor failures:\n  P(b) = 0.30 P(g) = 0.55  P(e) = 0.15\n For a system with major failures:\n  P(b) = 0.40 P(g) = 0.40  P(e) = 0.20\n\na. Compute the Overall Test Result Probabilities\n\n• P(b) = 0.70×0 + 0.20×0.30 + 0.10×0.40  \n    = 0 + 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.10\n\n• P(g) = 0.70×0.20 + 0.20×0.55 + 0.10×0.40  \n    = 0.14 + 0.11 + 0.04 = 0.29\n\n• P(e) = 0.70×0.80 + 0.20×0.15 + 0.10×0.20  \n    = 0.56 + 0.03 + 0.02 = 0.61\n\nb. Update the Beliefs via Bayes’ Rule\n\nFor each test outcome, we update the probabilities regarding the state of the advanced system:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nTest Outcome: Bad (b)\n P(smooth | b) = [P(b | smooth)×0.70] / 0.10 = (0×0.70) / 0.10 = 0  \n P(minor  | b) = [0.30×0.20] / 0.10 = 0.06 / 0.10 = 0.60  \n P(major  | b) = [0.40×0.10] / 0.10 = 0.04 / 0.10 = 0.40\n\n──────────────────────────────\nTest Outcome: Good (g)\n P(smooth | g) = [0.20×0.70] / 0.29 ≈ 0.14 / 0.29 ≈ 0.483  \n P(minor  | g) = [0.55×0.20] / 0.29 ≈ 0.11 / 0.29 ≈ 0.379  \n P(major  | g) = [0.40×0.10] / 0.29 ≈ 0.04 / 0.29 ≈ 0.138\n\n──────────────────────────────\nTest Outcome: Excellent (e)\n P(smooth | e) = [0.80×0.70] / 0.61 ≈ 0.56 / 0.61 ≈ 0.918  \n P(minor  | e) = [0.15×0.20] / 0.61 ≈ 0.03 / 0.61 ≈ 0.049  \n P(major  | e) = [0.20×0.10] / 0.61 ≈ 0.02 / 0.61 ≈ 0.033\n\n──────────────────────────────\nc. Compute Conditional Expected Utilities If the Advanced System Is Chosen After Testing\n\nWhen the test is conducted and the firm commits to the advanced system, the provided (post–test) utility outcomes are (with test cost already subtracted):\n • Smooth: 140  \n • Minor failure: –50  \n • Major failure: –130\n\nThus, for each test outcome we have:\n\n• For test result b:\n EU(advanced | b) = 0×140 + 0.60×(–50) + 0.40×(–130)\n       = 0 – 30 – 52 = –82\n\n• For test result g:\n EU(advanced | g) = 0.483×140 + 0.379×(–50) + 0.138×(–130)\n       ≈ 67.6 – 18.95 – 17.94 ≈ 30.71\n\n• For test result e:\n EU(advanced | e) = 0.918×140 + 0.049×(–50) + 0.033×(–130)\n       ≈ 128.5 – 2.45 – 4.29 ≈ 121.76\n\nd. Comparison with the Conventional System (if Test Is Conducted)\n\nIf the test is performed but the firm opts for the conventional system, the outcomes are:\n • Smooth: 50  \n • Failure: –40  \nwith probabilities (smooth = 0.95, failure = 0.05). Thus, regardless of the test result (since the test informs only about the advanced system), the expected utility is:\n\n EU(conventional, test) = 0.95×50 + 0.05×(–40)\n             = 47.5 – 2 = 45.5\n\ne. Decision Rule After Testing\n\nFor each test outcome, the company should choose the investment alternative that gives the higher expected utility:\n\n• If test result is Bad (b):\n – Advanced: –82  \n – Conventional: 45.5  \n → Choose Conventional\n\n• If test result is Good (g):\n – Advanced: ≈ 30.7  \n – Conventional: 45.5  \n → Choose Conventional\n\n• If test result is Excellent (e):\n – Advanced: ≈ 121.8  \n – Conventional: 45.5  \n → Choose Advanced\n\nf. Overall Expected Utility of the Testing Strategy\n\nWeight the payoffs by the test outcome probabilities:\n\n EU(test) = P(b)×45.5 + P(g)×45.5 + P(e)×121.8  \n     = 0.10×45.5 + 0.29×45.5 + 0.61×121.8  \n     = 4.55 + 13.20 + 74.30  \n     ≈ 92.05\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Final Comparison & Recommendation\n\n• Without testing, the best alternative is to choose the advanced system directly with an expected utility of €85M.  \n• With testing, by following the decision rule (choose conventional if test yields “bad” or “good,” and advanced only if “excellent”), the overall expected utility increases to approximately €92M.\n\nThus, the testing option provides an expected gain (or value of information) of roughly €7M.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Recommendation\n\n• At the strategic level, the company should choose to conduct the feasibility test prior to making the investment decision.  \n• Following the test, the optimal actions are:\n – If the test result is Excellent: Invest in the Advanced Robotics System.  \n – If the test result is Good or Bad: Invest in the Conventional Robotics System.\n• (The “do nothing” option is dominated by these investment alternatives based on the utilities provided.)\n\nThis decision maximizes the firm’s expected value by using the test information to avoid the high downside risk associated with the advanced system in cases where the test does not indicate a promising outcome.",
