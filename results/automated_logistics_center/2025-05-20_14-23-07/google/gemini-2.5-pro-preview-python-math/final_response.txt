The overall Expected Utility of the "Test Path" is EU(Test Path) ≈ €92.045 million.
My manual calculation was €92.043 million, the difference is due to rounding. The tool's result is more precise.

**Final Comparison:**
*   EU(No Test Path) = €85 million
*   EU(Test Path) ≈ €92.045 million

Since EU(Test Path) > EU(No Test Path) (€92.045M > €85M), the initial decision should be to conduct the test.

The results from the tool confirm my manual analysis.

Final Summary:

**1. Initial Decision: Should the company conduct the feasibility test?**
*   **Expected Utility of NOT Conducting the Test (EU_No_Test_Path):**
    *   If no test, the company would choose the Advanced System, with EU(Advanced | No Test) = €85 million.
    *   So, EU_No_Test_Path = €85 million.
*   **Expected Utility of Conducting the Test (EU_Test_Path):**
    *   This is calculated by considering the optimal decision after each possible test outcome:
        *   If Test = "bad" (P(E=b)=0.10): Choose Conventional System (EU = €45.5M).
        *   If Test = "good" (P(E=g)=0.29): Choose Conventional System (EU = €45.5M).
        *   If Test = "excellent" (P(E=e)=0.61): Choose Advanced System (EU ≈ €121.803M).
    *   EU_Test_Path = (0.10 * €45.5M) + (0.29 * €45.5M) + (0.61 * €121.803M) ≈ €4.55M + €13.195M + €74.300M ≈ **€92.045 million**.

*   **Decision:** Since EU_Test_Path (€92.045M) > EU_No_Test_Path (€85M), the company **should conduct the feasibility test**.

**2. Decisions after the Test (if conducted):**
*   **Observation: Test result is "bad" (b)**
    *   Updated (Posterior) Probabilities for Advanced System: P(A=s|E=b)=0, P(A=m|E=b)=0.6, P(A=M|E=b)=0.4
    *   EU(Advanced | Test, E=b) = -€82 million
    *   EU(Conventional | Test) = €45.5 million
    *   EU(Do Nothing | Test) = -€10 million
    *   **Rational Decision:** Choose **Conventional Robotics System** (Max EU = €45.5M).

*   **Observation: Test result is "good" (g)**
    *   Updated (Posterior) Probabilities for Advanced System: P(A=s|E=g)≈0.4828, P(A=m|E=g)≈0.3793, P(A=M|E=g)≈0.1379
    *   EU(Advanced | Test, E=g) ≈ €30.69 million
    *   EU(Conventional | Test) = €45.5 million
    *   EU(Do Nothing | Test) = -€10 million
    *   **Rational Decision:** Choose **Conventional Robotics System** (Max EU = €45.5M).

*   **Observation: Test result is "excellent" (e)**
    *   Updated (Posterior) Probabilities for Advanced System: P(A=s|E=e)≈0.9180, P(A=m|E=e)≈0.0492, P(A=M|E=e)≈0.0328
    *   EU(Advanced | Test, E=e) ≈ €121.80 million
    *   EU(Conventional | Test) = €45.5 million
    *   EU(Do Nothing | Test) = -€10 million
    *   **Rational Decision:** Choose **Advanced Robotics System** (Max EU ≈ €121.80M).

**Final Recommendation:**

The company should **initially decide to conduct the feasibility test**. This decision maximizes the overall expected utility to approximately €92.045 million.
Based on the outcome of the test:
*   If the test result is **bad** or **good**, the company should then choose to implement the **Conventional Robotics System**.
*   If the test result is **excellent**, the company should then choose to implement the **Advanced Robotics System**.E-commerce Company Logistics Center Automation Decision Analysis

**1. Strategy if "No Test" is Conducted**

First, let's determine the best course of action if the company decides *not* to conduct the feasibility test.
*   Expected Utility of Advanced System (No Test) = (0.70 * €150M) + (0.20 * -€40M) + (0.10 * -€120M) = €105M - €8M - €12M = **€85 million**.
*   Expected Utility of Conventional System (No Test) = (0.95 * €60M) + (0.05 * -€30M) = €57M - €1.5M = **€55.5 million**.
*   Expected Utility of Doing Nothing = **€0 million**.

Comparing these, if no test is conducted, the optimal decision is to invest in the **Advanced Robotics System**, with an expected utility of €85 million. This value, €85M, represents the overall expected utility of the "No Test" strategic path.

**2. Strategy if "Test" is Conducted**

If the company conducts the test, we first need the probabilities of each test outcome:
*   P(Test = bad) = (0.00 * 0.70) + (0.30 * 0.20) + (0.40 * 0.10) = 0 + 0.06 + 0.04 = **0.10**
*   P(Test = good) = (0.20 * 0.70) + (0.55 * 0.20) + (0.40 * 0.10) = 0.14 + 0.11 + 0.04 = **0.29**
*   P(Test = excellent) = (0.80 * 0.70) + (0.15 * 0.20) + (0.20 * 0.10) = 0.56 + 0.03 + 0.02 = **0.61**
    *(Sum of probabilities = 0.10 + 0.29 + 0.61 = 1.00)*

Next, we determine the optimal decision for each test outcome. The utilities for investment choices after the test already include the €10M test cost. The utility of "Do Nothing" after a test implies the test cost was incurred for no subsequent investment benefit, so its utility is €0M - €10M = -€10M. The EU of the Conventional system after testing is (0.95 * €50M) + (0.05 * -€40M) = €47.5M - €2M = **€45.5 million**, regardless of the test outcome (as the test informs only about the Advanced system).

*   **A. If Test Result is "bad" (P=0.10):**
    *   Posterior probabilities for Advanced System:
        *   P(Smooth|bad) = (0.00 * 0.70) / 0.10 = 0
        *   P(Minor failure|bad) = (0.30 * 0.20) / 0.10 = 0.60
        *   P(Major failure|bad) = (0.40 * 0.10) / 0.10 = 0.40
    *   EU(Advanced | Test, bad) = (0 * €140M) + (0.60 * -€50M) + (0.40 * -€130M) = -€30M - €52M = **-€82 million**.
    *   EU(Conventional | Test) = **€45.5 million**.
    *   EU(Do Nothing | Test) = **-€10 million**.
    *   **Decision if "bad":** Choose **Conventional System** (Max EU = €45.5M).

*   **B. If Test Result is "good" (P=0.29):**
    *   Posterior probabilities for Advanced System:
        *   P(Smooth|good) = (0.20 * 0.70) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4828
        *   P(Minor failure|good) = (0.55 * 0.20) / 0.29 ≈ 0.3793
        *   P(Major failure|good) = (0.40 * 0.10) / 0.29 ≈ 0.1379
    *   EU(Advanced | Test, good) ≈ (0.4828 * €140M) + (0.3793 * -€50M) + (0.1379 * -€130M) ≈ €67.59M - €18.97M - €17.93M ≈ **€30.69 million**.
    *   EU(Conventional | Test) = **€45.5 million**.
    *   EU(Do Nothing | Test) = **-€10 million**.
    *   **Decision if "good":** Choose **Conventional System** (Max EU = €45.5M).

*   **C. If Test Result is "excellent" (P=0.61):**
    *   Posterior probabilities for Advanced System:
        *   P(Smooth|excellent) = (0.80 * 0.70) / 0.61 ≈ 0.9180
        *   P(Minor failure|excellent) = (0.15 * 0.20) / 0.61 ≈ 0.0492
        *   P(Major failure|excellent) = (0.20 * 0.10) / 0.61 ≈ 0.0328
    *   EU(Advanced | Test, excellent) ≈ (0.9180 * €140M) + (0.0492 * -€50M) + (0.0328 * -€130M) ≈ €128.52M - €2.46M - €4.26M ≈ **€121.80 million**.
    *   EU(Conventional | Test) = **€45.5 million**.
    *   EU(Do Nothing | Test) = **-€10 million**.
    *   **Decision if "excellent":** Choose **Advanced System** (Max EU ≈ €121.80M).

**Overall Expected Utility of the "Test" Strategic Path:**
EU(Test Path) = P(bad)*EU(Decision|bad) + P(good)*EU(Decision|good) + P(excellent)*EU(Decision|excellent)
EU(Test Path) = (0.10 * €45.5M) + (0.29 * €45.5M) + (0.61 * €121.803M)
EU(Test Path) ≈ €4.55M + €13.195M + €74.30M ≈ **€92.045 million**.

**3. Initial Decision: Test or No Test?**

*   Expected Utility of "No Test" Path = €85 million.
*   Expected Utility of "Test" Path ≈ €92.045 million.

Since €92.045M > €85M, the rational decision is to **conduct the feasibility test**.

**Final Recommendation:**

The company should **initially decide to conduct the €10 million feasibility test**, as this strategy maximizes the overall expected utility to approximately **€92.045 million**.

The subsequent investment decision should be based on the test outcome:
*   If the test result is **"bad"** or **"good"**, the company should invest in the **Conventional Robotics System**.
*   If the test result is **"excellent"**, the company should invest in the **Advanced Robotics System**.
