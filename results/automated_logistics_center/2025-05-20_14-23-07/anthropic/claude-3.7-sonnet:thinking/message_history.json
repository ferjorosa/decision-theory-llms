The company has three strategic options:\n\n1. **Conventional Robotics System**: This offers moderate automation and proven reliability.\n2. **Advanced Robotics System**: This system is highly automated and AI-powered, but it carries greater technical risk.\n3. **Do Nothing**: The current logistics system is retained with no investment.\n\n### Optional Feasibility Test\n\nBefore committing to the advanced system, the company may choose to conduct a feasibility test on critical system components. The test costs €10 million and yields one of three results: **bad (b)**, **good (g)**, or **excellent (e)**.\n\nThe test outcome depends on the true performance category of the advanced system:\n\n- If the system is fully functional (smooth):\n  - Probability of a good result: 0.20\n  - Probability of an excellent result: 0.80\n\n- If the system is prone to minor failures:\n  - Probability of a bad result: 0.30\n  - Probability of a good result: 0.55\n  - Probability of an excellent result: 0.15\n\n- If the system is prone to major failures:\n  - Probability of a bad result: 0.40\n  - Probability of a good result: 0.40\n  - Probability of an excellent result: 0.20\n\n### Prior Probabilities\n\nFor the **advanced system**, the prior probabilities for each possible state are as follows:\n\n- Smooth operation: 0.70\n- Minor failure: 0.20\n- Major failure: 0.10\n\nFor the **conventional system**, the prior probabilities are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 0.95\n- Failure: 0.05\n\n### Outcome Utilities\n\nUtility is expressed in millions of euros and reflects the net value of each scenario.\n\n#### Utility Notation\n\n- **T**: Testing strategy (either `test`, `no test`, or `do nothing`)\n- **I**: Investment decision (`advanced` or `conventional`)\n- **A**: Outcome for the advanced system (`smooth`, `minor failure`, or `major failure`)\n- **C**: Outcome for the conventional system (`smooth` or `failure`)\n- **U**: Utility in € million\n\n#### Utility Values\n\nIf the company **conducts the test** and then selects the **advanced system**, the utility values (after subtracting the €10M test cost) are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 140\n- Minor failure: -50\n- Major failure: -130\n\nIf the company **conducts the test** and then selects the **conventional system**, the utility values are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 50\n- Failure: -40\n\nIf the company **does not conduct the test** and chooses the **advanced system**, the utility values are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 150\n- Minor failure: -40\n- Major failure: -120\n\nIf the company **does not conduct the test** and chooses the **conventional system**, the utility values are:\n\n- Smooth operation: 60\n- Failure: -30\n\n### Decision Sequence\n\nThe company follows this decision sequence:\n\n1. Choose whether to conduct the feasibility test.\n2. If the test is conducted, observe the test result (bad, good, or excellent).\n3. Update beliefs (posterior probabilities) based on the test result.\n4. Choose the investment strategy that maximizes expected utility.\n\n\n## Objective\n\nGiven the problem description above, your task is to identify the rational decision(s) at each point in the process. Use the information provided to evaluate the options and explain your reasoning clearly. Return your final recommendation based on sound analysis.\n"

    "content": "# Decision Analysis: Logistics Center Automation\n\nI'll solve this decision problem by working backwards through the decision sequence, calculating expected utilities at each stage.\n\n## Part 1: Posterior Probabilities After Testing\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the posterior probabilities if the company conducts the test, using Bayes' rule.\n\nLet's denote:\n- S = system is smooth\n- MiF = minor failure\n- MaF = major failure\n- b, g, e = test results (bad, good, excellent)\n\n### Prior Probabilities:\n- P(S) = 0.70\n- P(MiF) = 0.20\n- P(MaF) = 0.10\n\n### Likelihood of Test Results:\n- P(g|S) = 0.20, P(e|S) = 0.80, P(b|S) = 0\n- P(b|MiF) = 0.30, P(g|MiF) = 0.55, P(e|MiF) = 0.15\n- P(b|MaF) = 0.40, P(g|MaF) = 0.40, P(e|MaF) = 0.20\n\n### Calculating P(b), P(g), P(e):\n- P(b) = P(b|S)×P(S) + P(b|MiF)×P(MiF) + P(b|MaF)×P(MaF)\n- P(b) = 0×0.70 + 0.30×0.20 + 0.40×0.10 = 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.10\n\n- P(g) = P(g|S)×P(S) + P(g|MiF)×P(MiF) + P(g|MaF)×P(MaF)\n- P(g) = 0.20×0.70 + 0.55×0.20 + 0.40×0.10 = 0.14 + 0.11 + 0.04 = 0.29\n\n- P(e) = P(e|S)×P(S) + P(e|MiF)×P(MiF) + P(e|MaF)×P(MaF)\n- P(e) = 0.80×0.70 + 0.15×0.20 + 0.20×0.10 = 0.56 + 0.03 + 0.02 = 0.61\n\n### Posterior Probabilities:\n\n**After Bad Result (b):**\n- P(S|b) = P(b|S)×P(S)/P(b) = 0×0.70/0.10 = 0\n- P(MiF|b) = P(b|MiF)×P(MiF)/P(b) = 0.30×0.20/0.10 = 0.60\n- P(MaF|b) = P(b|MaF)×P(MaF)/P(b) = 0.40×0.10/0.10 = 0.40\n\n**After Good Result (g):**\n- P(S|g) = P(g|S)×P(S)/P(g) = 0.20×0.70/0.29 = 0.483\n- P(MiF|g) = P(g|MiF)×P(MiF)/P(g) = 0.55×0.20/0.29 = 0.379\n- P(MaF|g) = P(g|MaF)×P(MaF)/P(g) = 0.40×0.10/0.29 = 0.138\n\n**After Excellent Result (e):**\n- P(S|e) = P(e|S)×P(S)/P(e) = 0.80×0.70/0.61 = 0.918\n- P(MiF|e) = P(e|MiF)×P(MiF)/P(e) = 0.15×0.20/0.61 = 0.049\n- P(MaF|e) = P(e|MaF)×P(MaF)/P(e) = 0.20×0.10/0.61 = 0.033\n\n## Part 2: Expected Utilities After Test Results\n\n### For the conventional system:\n- EU(conventional) = 0.95 × 50 + 0.05 × (-40) = 47.5 - 2 = 45.5\n\n### For the advanced system after each test result:\n\n**After Bad Result:**\n- EU(advanced|b) = 0 × 140 + 0.60 × (-50) + 0.40 × (-130)\n- EU(advanced|b) = 0 - 30 - 52 = -82\n\n**After Good Result:**\n- EU(advanced|g) = 0.483 × 140 + 0.379 × (-50) + 0.138 × (-130)\n- EU(advanced|g) = 67.62 - 18.95 - 17.94 = 30.73\n\n**After Excellent Result:**\n- EU(advanced|e) = 0.918 × 140 + 0.049 × (-50) + 0.033 × (-130)\n- EU(advanced|e) = 128.52 - 2.45 - 4.29 = 121.78\n\n### Optimal Decision After Each Test Result:\n- After Bad Result: Choose Conventional (45.5 > -82)\n- After Good Result: Choose Conventional (45.5 > 30.73)\n- After Excellent Result: Choose Advanced (121.78 > 45.5)\n\n## Part 3: Expected Value of Testing\n\nThe expected utility of testing is:\n- P(b) × EU(best option|b) + P(g) × EU(best option|g) + P(e) × EU(best option|e)\n- 0.10 × 45.5 + 0.29 × 45.5 + 0.61 × 121.78\n- 4.55 + 13.20 + 74.29 = 92.04\n\n## Part 4: Expected Utilities Without Testing\n\n### For the conventional system:\n- EU(conventional) = 0.95 × 60 + 0.05 × (-30) = 57 - 1.5 = 55.5\n\n### For the advanced system:\n- EU(advanced) = 0.70 × 150 + 0.20 × (-40) + 0.10 × (-120)\n- EU(advanced) = 105 - 8 - 12 = 85\n\n### Optimal Decision Without Testing:\nChoose the Advanced System (85 > 55.5)\n\n## Final Recommendation\n\n1. **Best Option**: Do not conduct the test and choose the advanced robotics system.\n   - Expected utility: 85 million euros\n\n2. **Reasoning**:\n   - The expected utility of the no-test + advanced system strategy (85) is higher than conducting the test (92.04 - 10 = 82.04).\n   - The test's information value doesn't justify its €10M cost in this scenario.\n   - The advanced system offers significantly higher upside potential, and the prior probability of smooth operation (70%) is strong enough to justify taking the higher risk without testing.\n\n3. **Sensitivity Analysis**:\n   - If the company is particularly risk-averse, the conventional system provides more consistent results with less downside.\n   - However, based purely on expected utility maximization, the advanced system without testing is the optimal choice.\n\nThe analysis shows that the company's strong prior belief in the advanced system's success (70%) makes testing unnecessary from a rational decision-making perspective.",
