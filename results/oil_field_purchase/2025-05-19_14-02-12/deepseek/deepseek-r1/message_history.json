We can represent the reliability of the test as a conditional probability distribution P(R | Q) where:\n\n**High Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|high) = 0.95 → Strong indicator of quality  \n- P(Fail|high) = 0.05 → Rare false negative  \n\n**Medium Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|medium) = 0.7 → Moderate correlation  \n- P(Fail|medium) = 0.3  \n\n**Low Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|low) = 0.15 → Rare false positive  \n- P(Fail|low) = 0.85 → Strong indicator of poor quality  \n\n### Outcome Utilities  \nTo evaluate the decision problem, we need to define the value (utility) of each outcome. This utility reflects the desirability of a particular scenario (buying the field after a successful test, etc.).\n\n#### If Test Performed  \n- **Buy (after observing R):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1250M\n  - Q = Medium → +\\$630M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$0M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$350M  \n\n*(Note: test cost \\$30M is already subtracted from all of these figures.)*\n\n#### If No Test  \n- **Buy (direct):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1280M  \n  - Q = Medium → +\\$660M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$30M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$380M  \n\n### Decision Sequence  \n1. Decide whether to perform the Porosity Test.  \n2. If tested, observe result R.  \n3. Decide whether to buy the oil field.  \n\n## Objective\n\nGiven the problem description above, your task is to identify the rational decision(s) at each point in the process.

    "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this oil field investment decision problem. Hmm, the company has to decide whether to buy the oil field, and whether to perform a porosity test first. The test costs $30M, so that's a factor. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the decision. The company can choose to test or not. If they test, they get a result (Pass or Fail), and then decide to buy or not. If they don't test, they just decide to buy or not based on the prior probabilities. The utilities depend on the quality of the oil field, which is uncertain.\n\nLet me start by calculating the expected utility of buying without any test. The prior probabilities are given: High (0.35), Medium (0.45), Low (0.20). The utilities for buying without testing are $1280M, $660M, and $30M respectively. So the expected value (EV) here would be:\n\nEV(Buy without test) = 0.35*1280 + 0.45*660 + 0.20*30.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.35*1280 = 448, 0.45*660 = 297, 0.20*30 = 6. Adding those up: 448 + 297 = 745, plus 6 is 751. So the expected value is $751M. If they don't buy, they get $380M. So comparing 751 vs 380, buying without testing seems better. So without testing, the optimal decision is to Buy, with EV 751M.\n\nNow, if they perform the test, they have to subtract the $30M cost. Wait, but the utilities for the test case already include the cost. The problem states that the test cost is already subtracted. So when calculating the expected utilities after testing, we don't need to subtract another $30M.\n\nBut first, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of Q given the test result R (Pass or Fail). Then, for each possible test result, compute the expected utility of buying vs not buying, and choose the better option for each. Then, compute the overall expected value of doing the test by averaging over the possible test results.\n\nSo let's start by finding the probabilities of Pass and Fail. Using the law of total probability:\n\nP(Pass) = P(Pass|High)*P(High) + P(Pass|Medium)*P(Medium) + P(Pass|Low)*P(Low)\n= 0.95*0.35 + 0.7*0.45 + 0.15*0.20\n\nCalculating each term:\n0.95*0.35 = 0.3325\n0.7*0.45 = 0.315\n0.15*0.20 = 0.03\nAdding up: 0.3325 + 0.315 = 0.6475 + 0.03 = 0.6775. So P(Pass) = 0.6775.\n\nSimilarly, P(Fail) = 1 - 0.6775 = 0.3225.\n\nNow, compute the posterior probabilities P(Q | R) for each R.\n\nFor R = Pass:\n\nP(High | Pass) = P(Pass | High)*P(High)/P(Pass) = 0.95*0.35 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.4907\n\nP(Medium | Pass) = 0.7*0.45 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.4649\n\nP(Low | Pass) = 0.15*0.20 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.0443\n\nCheck that these sum to 1: 0.4907 + 0.4649 + 0.0443 ≈ 1.0, which is correct.\n\nFor R = Fail:\n\nP(High | Fail) = P(Fail | High)*P(High)/P(Fail) = 0.05*0.35 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.0543\n\nP(Medium | Fail) = 0.3*0.45 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.4186\n\nP(Low | Fail) = 0.85*0.20 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.5271\n\nCheck sum: 0.0543 + 0.4186 + 0.5271 ≈ 1.0, correct.\n\nNow, for each test result, compute the expected utility of buying vs not buying.\n\nIf R = Pass:\n\nEV(Buy | Pass) = 0.4907*1250 + 0.4649*630 + 0.0443*0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.4907*1250 ≈ 613.375\n\n0.4649*630 ≈ 292.887\n\n0.0443*0 = 0\n\nTotal ≈ 613.375 + 292.887 ≈ 906.262M\n\nEV(Not Buy | Pass) = 350M.\n\nSo if Pass, better to Buy with EV ~906.26M.\n\nIf R = Fail:\n\nEV(Buy | Fail) = 0.0543*1250 + 0.4186*630 + 0.5271*0\n\nCalculating:\n\n0.0543*1250 ≈ 67.875\n\n0.4186*630 ≈ 263.718\n\n0.5271*0 = 0\n\nTotal ≈ 67.875 + 263.718 ≈ 331.593M\n\nEV(Not Buy | Fail) = 350M.\n\nComparing 331.59M vs 350M, better to Not Buy if Fail.\n\nSo, the expected value of performing the test is:\n\nEV(Test) = P(Pass)*EV(Buy | Pass) + P(Fail)*EV(Not Buy | Fail)\n\n= 0.6775*906.262 + 0.3225*350\n\nCompute each part:\n\n0.6775*906.262 ≈ Let's compute 0.6775*900 = 609.75, and 0.6775*6.262 ≈ ~4.24, total ≈ 613.99M\n\n0.3225*350 = 112.875M\n\nTotal EV(Test) ≈ 613.99 + 112.875 ≈ 726.865M\n\nCompare this to the EV of not testing, which was 751M. So EV(Test) ≈ 726.87M vs EV(No Test) = 751M. Therefore, it's better to not perform the test and directly buy, since 751 > 726.87.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check my calculations again because this seems counterintuitive. The test costs $30M, but the utilities already account for that. So maybe the test's EV is lower than not testing because the cost is already subtracted. But according to the numbers, even after considering the test's information, the expected value is lower than not testing. So the optimal decision is to skip the test and buy directly.\n\nBut let me verify the numbers again to make sure.\n\nFirst, EV(Buy without test):\n\n0.35*1280 = 448\n\n0.45*660 = 297\n\n0.20*30 = 6\n\nTotal: 448 + 297 = 745 +6=751. Correct.\n\nEV(Test):\n\nFor Pass: 0.6775*906.262 ≈ 0.6775*906.262. Let's compute 0.6775 * 900 = 609.75, 0.6775*6.262 ≈ ~4.24, total ≈ 614. So 614M.\n\nFor Fail: 0.3225*350 = 112.875M.\n\nTotal EV(Test) = 614 + 112.875 ≈ 726.875M.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 726.875M is less than 751M, so better to not test.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to not perform the test and buy the oil field directly, resulting in an expected utility of $751M.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the utilities. The problem says that if you test, the utilities already subtract the $30M. So when you don't test, the \"Buy\" utilities are higher because they didn't spend $30M. For example, buying without test gives $1280M for High, which is $1250M + $30M saved from not testing. Similarly, the \"Do Not Buy\" without test is $380M, which is $350M + $30M saved. So the numbers make sense.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is correct. Even though the test provides information, the cost of the test outweighs the benefit of the information in this case, leading to a lower expected utility compared to not testing and buying directly.\n"
