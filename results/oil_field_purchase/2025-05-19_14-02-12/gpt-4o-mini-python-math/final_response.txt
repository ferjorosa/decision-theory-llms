Here are the detailed calculations and results from the analysis:

### Probabilities and Utilities

1. **Prior Probabilities of Quality:**
   - \( P(\text{High}) = 0.35 \)
   - \( P(\text{Medium}) = 0.45 \)
   - \( P(\text{Low}) = 0.20 \)

2. **Test Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{Pass} | \text{High}) = 0.95 \)
   - \( P(\text{Pass} | \text{Medium}) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{Pass} | \text{Low}) = 0.15 \)

   - \( P(\text{Fail} | \text{High}) = 0.05 \)
   - \( P(\text{Fail} | \text{Medium}) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(\text{Fail} | \text{Low}) = 0.85 \)

### Post-Test Probabilities

3. **Calculating the probability of the test outcomes:**
   - Probability of passing the test:
     \[
     P(R = \text{Pass}) = 0.6775
     \]
   - Probability of failing the test:
     \[
     P(R = \text{Fail}) = 0.3225
     \]

4. **Post-test probabilities given that the test result is "Pass":**
   - \( P(\text{High} | R = \text{Pass}) \approx 0.491 \)
   - \( P(\text{Medium} | R = \text{Pass}) \approx 0.465 \)
   - \( P(\text{Low} | R = \text{Pass}) \approx 0.044 \)

5. **Post-test probabilities given that the test result is "Fail":**
   - \( P(\text{High} | R = \text{Fail}) \approx 0.054 \)
   - \( P(\text{Medium} | R = \text{Fail}) \approx 0.419 \)
   - \( P(\text{Low} | R = \text{Fail}) \approx 0.527 \)

### Expected Utilities

6. **Buying after a "Pass":**
   \[
   E[U | R = \text{Pass}] = 906.38
   \]

7. **Buying after a "Fail":**
   \[
   E[U | R = \text{Fail}] = 331.55
   \]

8. **Total Expected Utility after the Test:**
   \[
   E[U_{\text{test}}] = P(R = \text{Pass}) \cdot E[U | R = \text{Pass}] + P(R = \text{Fail}) \cdot E[U | R = \text{Fail}] - \text{cost of test}
   \]
   \[
   E[U_{\text{test}}] \approx 690.99
   \]  

### No-Test Option

9. **Expected Utility without performing the test:**
   - Buying outcomes:
     \[
     E[U_{\text{no test}}] = 751.00
     \]

### Comparison

- **Expected Utility with Test (after cost):** \( 690.99 \)
- **Expected Utility without Test:** \( 751.00 \)

### Conclusion

The final recommendation based on this analysis is to **NOT perform the Porosity Test** and proceed directly to purchasing the oil field, as this option has a higher expected utility (\$751M) compared to performing the test and adjusting for its cost (\$690.99M).
