* R1 returned an exception, so it probably does not have tool calling available in OpenRouter
* Gemini 2.5 pro simply ignored the tool call. Probably it does not have it available via OpenRouter. We have done other test and it also ignored the tool call.
* o3-mini-high opted for not using the tool. We know tested and tool calling works with it in OpenRouter.
