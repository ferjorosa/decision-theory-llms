    "content": "## Oil Field Investment Decision Problem  \n\n### Problem Overview  \nAn oil company must decide whether to **buy (B)** an oil field whose true quality **Q** is uncertain.  \n\nQ has three possible states:\n- **High**: Exceptional reserves, high-profit potential  \n- **Medium**: Moderate reserves, acceptable profit  \n- **Low**: Poor reserves, high financial risk  \n\nHistorical and survey data give the prior probabilities:\n- P(Q = High) = 0.35  \n- P(Q = Medium) = 0.45\n- P(Q = Low)   = 0.20  \n\n### Information-Gathering Option  \nThe company may optionally perform a **Porosity Test** at cost \\$30M (i.e.\\ \\$30 million):  \n- **Result R = “Pass”** if porosity ≥ 15%  \n- **Result R = “Fail”** if porosity < 15%  \n- Or skip testing and go straight to the purchase decision.\n\n#### Test Reliability \n\nThe test provides imperfect but valuable information about the true quality of the field. We can represent the reliability of the test as a conditional probability distribution P(R | Q) where:\n\n**High Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|high) = 0.95 → Strong indicator of quality  \n- P(Fail|high) = 0.05 → Rare false negative  \n\n**Medium Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|medium) = 0.7 → Moderate correlation  \n- P(Fail|medium) = 0.3  \n\n**Low Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|low) = 0.15 → Rare false positive  \n- P(Fail|low) = 0.85 → Strong indicator of poor quality  \n\n### Outcome Utilities  \nTo evaluate the decision problem, we need to define the value (utility) of each outcome. This utility reflects the desirability of a particular scenario (buying the field after a successful test, etc.).\n\n#### If Test Performed  \n- **Buy (after observing R):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1250M\n  - Q = Medium → +\\$630M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$0M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$350M  \n\n*(Note: test cost \\$30M is already subtracted from all of these figures.)*\n\n#### If No Test  \n- **Buy (direct):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1280M  \n  - Q = Medium → +\\$660M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$30M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$380M  \n\n### Decision Sequence  \n1. Decide whether to perform the Porosity Test.  \n2. If tested, observe result R.  \n3. Decide whether to buy the oil field.  \n\n## Objective\n\nGiven the problem description above, your task is to identify the rational decision(s) at each point in the process. Use the information provided to evaluate the options and explain your reasoning clearly. Return your final recommendation based on sound analysis.\n"

    "content": "To approach the Oil Field Investment Decision Problem, we need to analyze the expected utility of each decision strategy. We must evaluate whether it is better to perform the Porosity Test or to proceed directly to purchasing the oil field without the test.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluating the Test Option\n\nFirst, we will calculate the expected utility of buying the oil field after performing the Porosity Test based on possible test outcomes. We will use Bayes' theorem to update the prior probabilities of the quality given the test result:\n\n1. **Calculating post-test probabilities**\n\n   - **If Test Result is Pass (R = Pass):**\n     We need to compute: \n     \\[\n     P(Q | R = Pass) = \\frac{P(R = Pass | Q) \\cdot P(Q)}{P(R = Pass)}\n     \\]\n\n      where:\n      \\[\n      P(R = Pass) = P(R = Pass | \\text{High}) \\cdot P(\\text{High}) + P(R = Pass | \\text{Medium}) \\cdot P(\\text{Medium}) + P(R = Pass | \\text{Low}) \\cdot P(\\text{Low})\n      \\]\n\n      Substituting the values:\n      \\[\n      P(R = Pass) = (0.95 \\cdot 0.35) + (0.7 \\cdot 0.45) + (0.15 \\cdot 0.20) = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03 = 0.6775\n      \\]\n\n      Now we calculate the posterior probabilities:\n      - **High Quality:**  \n      \\[\n      P(\\text{High} | R = Pass) = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.35}{0.6775} \\approx 0.460\n      \\]\n      - **Medium Quality:**  \n      \\[\n      P(\\text{Medium} | R = Pass) = \\frac{0.7 \\cdot 0.45}{0.6775} \\approx 0.465\n      \\]\n      - **Low Quality:**  \n      \\[\n      P(\\text{Low} | R = Pass) = \\frac{0.15 \\cdot 0.20}{0.6775} \\approx 0.030\n      \\]\n\n   - **If Test Result is Fail (R = Fail):**\n     Similarly, we compute:\n     \\[\n     P(R = Fail) = P(R = Fail | \\text{High}) \\cdot P(\\text{High}) + P(R = Fail | \\text{Medium}) \\cdot P(\\text{Medium}) + P(R = Fail | \\text{Low}) \\cdot P(\\text{Low})\n     \\]\n     Substituting values:\n     \\[\n     P(R = Fail) = (0.05 \\cdot 0.35) + (0.3 \\cdot 0.45) + (0.85 \\cdot 0.20) = 0.0175 + 0.135 + 0.17 = 0.3225\n     \\]\n\n      And the posterior probabilities:\n      - **High Quality:**  \n      \\[\n      P(\\text{High} | R = Fail) = \\frac{0.05 \\cdot 0.35}{0.3225} \\approx 0.054\n      \\]\n      - **Medium Quality:**  \n      \\[\n      P(\\text{Medium} | R = Fail) = \\frac{0.3 \\cdot 0.45}{0.3225} \\approx 0.419\n      \\]\n      - **Low Quality:**  \n      \\[\n      P(\\text{Low} | R = Fail) = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.20}{0.3225} \\approx 0.527\n      \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the expected utilities if test is performed:**\n\n   The expected utility will be computed for both test outcomes:\n\n   - **Expected Utility if R = Pass:**\n   \\[\n   E[U | R = Pass] = P(\\text{High} | R = Pass) \\cdot (1250) + P(\\text{Medium} | R = Pass) \\cdot (630) + P(\\text{Low} | R = Pass) \\cdot (0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[U | R = Pass] = 0.460 \\cdot 1250 + 0.465 \\cdot 630 + 0.030 \\cdot 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[U | R = Pass] = 575 + 292.95 = 867.95\n   \\]\n\n   - **Expected Utility if R = Fail:**\n   \\[\n   E[U | R = Fail] = P(\\text{High} | R = Fail) \\cdot (1250) + P(\\text{Medium} | R = Fail) \\cdot (630) + P(\\text{Low} | R = Fail) \\cdot (0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[U | R = Fail] = 0.054 \\cdot 1250 + 0.419 \\cdot 630 + 0.527 \\cdot 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[U | R = Fail] = 67.5 + 263.97 = 331.47\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Expected Utility for Test:**\n   \\[\n   E[U_{\\text{test}}] = P(R = Pass) \\cdot E[U | R = Pass] + P(R = Fail) \\cdot E[U | R = Fail]\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[U_{\\text{test}}] = 0.6775 \\cdot 867.95 + 0.3225 \\cdot 331.47\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E[U_{\\text{test}}] = 588.10 + 106.59 = 694.69\n   \\]\n   After accounting for the testing cost:\n   \\[\n   E[U_{\\text{test}}] - 30 = 694.69 - 30 = 664.69\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating the No-Test Option\n\nNext, we will calculate the expected utility if the company skips the test and makes a purchase decision directly.\n\n\\[\nE[U_{\\text{no test}}] = P(Q = High) \\cdot (1280) + P(Q = Medium) \\cdot (660) + P(Q = Low) \\cdot (30)\n\\]\n\\[\nE[U_{\\text{no test}}] = 0.35 \\cdot 1280 + 0.45 \\cdot 660 + 0.20 \\cdot 30\n\\]\n\\[\nE[U_{\\text{no test}}] = 448 + 297 + 6 = 751\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Comparison of Strategies\n\n- **Expected Utility if Porosity Test is Performed (after cost):** $664.69M\n- **Expected Utility if No Test is Performed:** $751M\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\nThe analysis shows that it is more favorable for the company to **skip the Porosity Test** and proceed directly to purchase the oil field, as it yields a higher expected utility ($751M) compared to performing the test and adjusting for its cost ($664.69M).\n\n**Recommendation: Do NOT perform the Porosity Test; directly proceed to purchase decision for the oil field.**",
