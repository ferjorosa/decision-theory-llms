    "content": "# Oil Field Investment Decision Analysis\n\n## Introduction\nThe decision problem involves whether to perform a porosity test before deciding to buy an oil field of uncertain quality. I'll analyze this using decision theory and expected utility calculations to determine the optimal strategy.\n\n## Decision Analysis\n\n### Without Test (Direct Decision)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected utility of buying without testing:\n\n- Buy without testing:\n  - P(High) = 0.35, Utility = $1280M\n  - P(Medium) = 0.45, Utility = $660M\n  - P(Low) = 0.20, Utility = $30M\n  - Expected Utility = (0.35 × $1280M) + (0.45 × $660M) + (0.20 × $30M) = $751M\n\n- Don't buy without testing:\n  - Utility = $380M\n\nSince $751M > $380M, the optimal decision without testing would be to buy the field.\n\n### With Test\n\nIf we perform the test, we need to calculate what we would do after observing each possible result.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of each test result:\n- P(Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) + (0.7 × 0.45) + (0.15 × 0.2) = 0.6775\n- P(Fail) = 1 - 0.6775 = 0.3225\n\nNow, using Bayes' rule, we can calculate the posterior probabilities of each quality level given the test result:\n\nFor test result \"Pass\":\n- P(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35)/0.6775 ≈ 0.491\n- P(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45)/0.6775 ≈ 0.465\n- P(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2)/0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nFor test result \"Fail\":\n- P(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35)/0.3225 ≈ 0.054\n- P(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45)/0.3225 ≈ 0.419\n- P(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2)/0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected utilities after each test result:\n\n1. After observing \"Pass\":\n   - Buy: (0.491 × $1250M) + (0.465 × $630M) + (0.044 × $0M) ≈ $906.7M\n   - Don't Buy: $350M\n   - Optimal decision after \"Pass\": Buy (higher utility)\n\n2. After observing \"Fail\":\n   - Buy: (0.054 × $1250M) + (0.419 × $630M) + (0.527 × $0M) ≈ $331.5M\n   - Don't Buy: $350M\n   - Optimal decision after \"Fail\": Don't Buy (higher utility)\n\nFinally, the overall expected utility of performing the test is:\n- Expected Utility = (0.6775 × $906.7M) + (0.3225 × $350M) ≈ $727.2M\n\n### Comparison and Decision\n\n- Expected utility of buying without testing: $751M\n- Expected utility of performing the test: $727.2M\n\nSince $751M > $727.2M, the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\n## Economic Interpretation\n\nThe value of information provided by the test is less than its cost ($30M). Although the test helps avoid buying low-quality fields (which happens with a \"Fail\" result), this benefit is outweighed by:\n\n1. The cost of the test itself\n2. The possibility of missing profitable opportunities (when medium or high-quality fields generate \"Fail\" results)\n\nGiven that there's an 80% prior probability of medium or high quality, and that even low-quality fields have some value ($30M without testing), the direct purchase strategy maximizes expected utility.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Optimal Strategy**: Do not perform the porosity test and directly buy the oil field.\n**Expected Utility**: $751M\n\nThis strategy is rational because the expected value of perfect information (about field quality) is less than the cost of acquiring imperfect information through testing.",

    "reasoning": "Alright, let's solve this oil field investment decision problem. This problem involves sequential decision making under uncertainty, and we can use Bayesian analysis and expected utility calculations to find the optimal strategy.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the structure of the decision problem\n\nWe have a decision tree with the following structure:\n1. First, decide whether to perform the Porosity Test.\n2. If we test, observe the result (Pass or Fail).\n3. Finally, decide whether to buy the oil field.\n\nThe outcome depends on the true quality Q of the oil field (High, Medium, or Low).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the \"No Test\" scenario first\n\nLet's calculate the expected utility for each action in the \"No Test\" scenario.\n\nIf we buy without testing:\n- P(Q = High) = 0.35, Utility = $1280M\n- P(Q = Medium) = 0.45, Utility = $660M\n- P(Q = Low) = 0.20, Utility = $30M\n\nExpected Utility = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.20 × $30M\n                 = $448M + $297M + $6M\n                 = $751M\n\nIf we don't buy without testing:\n- Utility = $380M\n\nSince $751M > $380M, the optimal decision in the \"No Test\" scenario is to buy the oil field, with an expected utility of $751M.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the \"Test\" scenario\n\nIf we perform the test, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities P(Q|R) using Bayes' rule.\n\nFirst, let's calculate P(R):\n\nP(R = Pass) = P(Pass|High) × P(High) + P(Pass|Medium) × P(Medium) + P(Pass|Low) × P(Low)\n            = 0.95 × 0.35 + 0.7 × 0.45 + 0.15 × 0.2\n            = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03\n            = 0.6775\n\nP(R = Fail) = 1 - P(R = Pass) = 1 - 0.6775 = 0.3225\n\nNow, calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:\n\nP(Q|R) = P(R|Q) × P(Q) / P(R)\n\nFor R = Pass:\n- P(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 = 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491\n- P(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45) / 0.6775 = 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465\n- P(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2) / 0.6775 = 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nFor R = Fail:\n- P(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 = 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054\n- P(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45) / 0.3225 = 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419\n- P(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2) / 0.3225 = 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nNow, calculate the expected utility for each action after observing the test result:\n\nFor R = Pass:\nIf we buy:\n- P(High|Pass) ≈ 0.491, Utility = $1250M\n- P(Medium|Pass) ≈ 0.465, Utility = $630M\n- P(Low|Pass) ≈ 0.044, Utility = $0M\n\nExpected Utility = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M\n                 = $613.75M + $292.95M + $0M\n                 = $906.7M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $906.7M > $350M, the optimal decision after observing R = Pass is to buy the oil field.\n\nFor R = Fail:\nIf we buy:\n- P(High|Fail) ≈ 0.054, Utility = $1250M\n- P(Medium|Fail) ≈ 0.419, Utility = $630M\n- P(Low|Fail) ≈ 0.527, Utility = $0M\n\nExpected Utility = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M\n                 = $67.5M + $264M + $0M\n                 = $331.5M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $331.5M < $350M, the optimal decision after observing R = Fail is not to buy the oil field.\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall expected utility of performing the test:\n\nExpected Utility of Test = P(R = Pass) × E[U|Pass] + P(R = Fail) × E[U|Fail]\n                        = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\n## Step 4: Compare the \"Test\" and \"No Test\" scenarios\n\nExpected Utility of No Test and Buy = $751M\nExpected Utility of Test = $727.2M\n\nSince $751M > $727.2M, the optimal strategy is not to perform the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nLet me double-check these calculations to make sure they are correct.\n\nActually, I think I need to be careful of the math here. Let me redo the post-test section more carefully:\n\nFor R = Pass:\nIf we buy:\n- P(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 = 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491\n- P(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45) / 0.6775 = 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465\n- P(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2) / 0.6775 = 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nExpected Utility = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M\n                 = $613.75M + $292.95M + $0M\n                 = $906.7M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $906.7M > $350M, the optimal decision after observing R = Pass is to buy the oil field.\n\nFor R = Fail:\nIf we buy:\n- P(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 = 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054\n- P(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45) / 0.3225 = 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419\n- P(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2) / 0.3225 = 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nExpected Utility = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M\n                 = $67.5M + $264M + $0M\n                 = $331.5M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $331.5M < $350M, the optimal decision after observing R = Fail is not to buy the oil field.\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall expected utility of performing the test, where we will buy if R = Pass and not buy if R = Fail:\n\nExpected Utility of Test = P(R = Pass) × E[U|Pass, Buy] + P(R = Fail) × E[U|Fail, Not Buy]\n                        = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\nExpected Utility of No Test and Buy = $751M\n\nSince $751M > $727.2M, the optimal strategy is not to perform the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nWait, I need to double check the expected utilities for the different cases. In particular, let's redo the \"No Test\" scenario and make sure I'm using the right values:\n\nIf we buy without testing:\n- P(Q = High) = 0.35, Utility = $1280M\n- P(Q = Medium) = 0.45, Utility = $660M\n- P(Q = Low) = 0.20, Utility = $30M\n\nExpected Utility = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.20 × $30M\n                 = $448M + $297M + $6M\n                 = $751M\n\nIf we don't buy without testing:\n- Utility = $380M\n\nSince $751M > $380M, the optimal decision in the \"No Test\" scenario is to buy the oil field, with an expected utility of $751M.\n\nNow, let's redo the \"Test\" scenario calculations:\n\nFor R = Pass:\nIf we buy after Pass:\n- P(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 = 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491\n- P(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45) / 0.6775 = 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465\n- P(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2) / 0.6775 = 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nExpected Utility = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M\n                 = $613.75M + $292.95M + $0M\n                 = $906.7M\n\nIf we don't buy after Pass:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $906.7M > $350M, the optimal decision after observing R = Pass is to buy the oil field.\n\nFor R = Fail:\nIf we buy after Fail:\n- P(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 = 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054\n- P(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45) / 0.3225 = 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419\n- P(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2) / 0.3225 = 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nExpected Utility = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M\n                 = $67.5M + $264M + $0M\n                 = $331.5M\n\nIf we don't buy after Fail:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $331.5M < $350M, the optimal decision after observing R = Fail is not to buy the oil field.\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall expected utility of performing the test, assuming optimal decisions after the test:\n\nExpected Utility of Test = P(R = Pass) × E[U|Pass, Buy] + P(R = Fail) × E[U|Fail, Not Buy]\n                        = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\nComparing with the \"No Test\" scenario:\nExpected Utility of No Test and Buy = $751M\nExpected Utility of Test (with optimal post-test decisions) = $727.2M\n\nSince $751M > $727.2M, the optimal strategy is not to perform the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nActually, I'm concerned that I'm not including the test cost correctly, so let me double-check this aspect. The problem states that the test costs $30M, and the utilities for the \"Test\" scenario already have this cost subtracted. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.\n\nOk, now that I've reread the problem, I see that the utility values provided in both the \"Test\" and \"No Test\" scenarios already account for the cost of the test. So my analysis above is correct.\n\nTo summarize the optimal strategy:\n1. Do not perform the Porosity Test.\n2. Buy the oil field directly.\n3. The expected utility of this strategy is $751M.\n\nLet me double-check that this makes sense intuitively:\n\nThe test is valuable because it allows us to avoid buying low-quality fields, as evidenced by our decision not to buy after a Fail result. However, the test isn't perfect (there are false positives and false negatives) and costs $30M. In this case, the prior probabilities favor Medium and High quality (collectively 80%), while Low quality is only 20%. The risk of making a poor investment in a Low-quality field is relatively small compared to the potential gains from High and Medium quality fields, especially when we consider the cost of testing.\n\nThus, it's rational to skip the test and directly buy the field, as the expected gain from having better information doesn't outweigh the cost of obtaining that information.\n\nActually, let me double-check the calculation of P(R = Pass) and P(R = Fail) as there's a chance I made an arithmetic error.\n\nP(R = Pass) = P(Pass|High) × P(High) + P(Pass|Medium) × P(Medium) + P(Pass|Low) × P(Low)\n            = 0.95 × 0.35 + 0.7 × 0.45 + 0.15 × 0.2\n            = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03\n            = 0.6775\n\nP(R = Fail) = 1 - P(R = Pass) = 1 - 0.6775 = 0.3225\n\nThese calculations are correct.\n\nNext, let me double-check the posterior probabilities:\n\nFor R = Pass:\n- P(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 = 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491\n- P(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45) / 0.6775 = 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465\n- P(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2) / 0.6775 = 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nFor R = Fail:\n- P(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 = 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054\n- P(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45) / 0.3225 = 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419\n- P(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2) / 0.3225 = 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nThese calculations also seem correct.\n\nNow, let me re-compute the expected utilities for buying or not buying after each test result:\n\nFor R = Pass:\nIf we buy:\nExpected Utility = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M\n                 = $613.75M + $292.95M + $0M\n                 = $906.7M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $906.7M > $350M, the optimal decision after Pass is to buy.\n\nFor R = Fail:\nIf we buy:\nExpected Utility = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M\n                 = $67.5M + $264M + $0M\n                 = $331.5M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $331.5M < $350M, the optimal decision after Fail is not to buy.\n\nNow, the overall expected utility of the Test strategy:\n\nExpected Utility of Test = P(R = Pass) × E[U|Pass, Buy] + P(R = Fail) × E[U|Fail, Not Buy]\n                        = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\nAnd for No Test:\nIf we buy without testing:\nExpected Utility = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.20 × $30M\n                 = $448M + $297M + $6M\n                 = $751M\n\nIf we don't buy without testing:\n- Utility = $380M\n\nSince $751M > $380M, the optimal decision without testing is to buy.\n\nComparing the Test and No Test strategies:\nExpected Utility of Test = $727.2M\nExpected Utility of No Test and Buy = $751M\n\nSince $751M > $727.2M, the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nHm, let me double-check one more time with a slight reorganization to make sure I have not made an error:\n\nIf we test and observe R = Pass:\n- Buy: Expected Utility = $906.7M (calculated above)\n- Don't Buy: Utility = $350M\n- Optimal decision after Pass: Buy with Expected Utility = $906.7M\n\nIf we test and observe R = Fail:\n- Buy: Expected Utility = $331.5M (calculated above)\n- Don't Buy: Utility = $350M\n- Optimal decision after Fail: Don't Buy with Expected Utility = $350M\n\nExpected Utility of Test = P(Pass) × E[U|Pass, optimal] + P(Fail) × E[U|Fail, optimal]\n                        = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\nIf we don't test:\n- Buy: Expected Utility = $751M (calculated above)\n- Don't Buy: Utility = $380M\n- Optimal decision without test: Buy with Expected Utility = $751M\n\nSince the Expected Utility of No Test and Buy ($751M) is greater than the Expected Utility of Test ($727.2M), the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nActually, let me triple check the expected utility of direct buy:\n\nExpected Utility = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.20 × $30M\n                 = $448M + $297M + $6M\n                 = $751M\n\nSo it is correct, and my overall conclusion is also correct. The optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nSo, my final answer is:\n\nOptimal Decision:\n1. Do not perform the Porosity Test.\n2. Buy the oil field directly.\n3. Expected utility: $751M.\n\nIntuitively, this makes sense because:\n- The prior probabilities favor High (35%) and Medium (45%) quality, with only a 20% chance of Low quality.\n- The test costs $30M, which is a significant amount.\n- The potential loss from buying a Low-quality field without testing is relatively small compared to the potential gains from High and Medium quality fields.\n- The value of information from the test doesn't outweigh its cost in this particular scenario.\n\nActually, let's just recheck our calculations from the very beginning, since the numbers are so close. Maybe I've made a subtle error.\n\n### No Test Scenario:\n\nIf we buy without testing:\n- P(Q = High) = 0.35, Utility = $1280M\n- P(Q = Medium) = 0.45, Utility = $660M\n- P(Q = Low) = 0.20, Utility = $30M\n\nExpected Utility = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.20 × $30M\n                 = $448M + $297M + $6M\n                 = $751M\n\nIf we don't buy without testing:\n- Utility = $380M\n\nSince $751M > $380M, the optimal decision without testing is to buy the oil field, with an expected utility of $751M.\n\n### Test Scenario:\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of each test result:\n\nP(R = Pass) = P(Pass|High) × P(High) + P(Pass|Medium) × P(Medium) + P(Pass|Low) × P(Low)\n            = 0.95 × 0.35 + 0.7 × 0.45 + 0.15 × 0.2\n            = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03\n            = 0.6775\n\nP(R = Fail) = 1 - P(R = Pass) = 1 - 0.6775 = 0.3225\n\nNext, calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:\n\nFor R = Pass:\n- P(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 = 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491\n- P(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45) / 0.6775 = 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465\n- P(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2) / 0.6775 = 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nFor R = Fail:\n- P(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 = 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054\n- P(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45) / 0.3225 = 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419\n- P(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2) / 0.3225 = 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nNow, calculate the expected utility for each action after the test:\n\nFor R = Pass:\nIf we buy:\nExpected Utility = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M\n                 = $613.75M + $292.95M + $0M\n                 = $906.7M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $906.7M > $350M, the optimal decision after Pass is to buy.\n\nFor R = Fail:\nIf we buy:\nExpected Utility = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M\n                 = $67.5M + $264M + $0M\n                 = $331.5M\n\nIf we don't buy:\n- Utility = $350M\n\nSince $331.5M < $350M, the optimal decision after Fail is not to buy.\n\nNow, calculate the overall expected utility of the Test strategy:\n\nExpected Utility of Test = P(R = Pass) × E[U|Pass, Buy] + P(R = Fail) × E[U|Fail, Not Buy]\n                        = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\nHmm, I'm a bit suspicious of myself here because P(High|Pass) = 0.491 and this is greater than the prior P(High) = 0.35, which makes sense since passing the test is evidence for higher quality. So my Bayesian posterior updates look correct, but let's be extra careful with the utility calculations.\n\nDouble-checking: \n$906.7M = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M\n       = $613.75M + $292.95M + $0M\n\nThat checks out.\n\n$331.5M = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M\n       = $67.5M + $264M + $0M\n\nThat also checks out.\n\nExpected Utility of Test = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n                        = $614.3M + $112.9M\n                        = $727.2M\n\nSo our utility calculation was correct: the expected utility of testing is $727.2M.\n\nAnd our calculation for buying without testing was:\nExpected Utility = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.20 × $30M\n                 = $448M + $297M + $6M\n                 = $751M\n\nSo our conclusion is correct: the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field, with an expected utility of $751M.\n\nLet's consider whether this result makes intuitive sense. The test costs $30M, and we can see that the \"No Test\" utilities are exactly $30M higher than the corresponding \"Test\" utilities. Additionally, the \"No Test\" expected utility for buying is $751M, while the \"Test\" expected utility is $727.2M, a difference of $23.8M. This means that the value of the information provided by the test is $6.2M ($30M - $23.8M = $6.2M), which is less than the cost of the test ($30M). So it's rational to skip the test.\n\nIt's also worth noting the difference in behavior if the test fails. In that case, our Bayesian update leads to a belief that the field has a high probability of being Low quality (52.7%), which makes not buying the optimal decision. This is the main benefit of the test: it helps us avoid buying a Low-quality field. However, in this problem, the probability of getting a Low-quality field is only 20%, and the cost of the test ($30M) is equal to the utility of buying a Low-quality field without testing. So the test isn't worth it.\n\nAdditionally, I'm a bit concerned that I may have misunderstood the utilities in the problem statement. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I'm interpreting the utilities correctly.\n\nActually, looking back at the problem statement, it says:\n\n\"If Test Performed\n- Buy (after observing R):\n  - Q = High → +$1250M\n  - Q = Medium → +$630M\n  - Q = Low → +$0M\n- Do Not Buy: +$350M\n\n(Note: test cost $30M is already subtracted from all of these figures.)\"\n\nThis confirms that the utilities provided already account for the cost of the test, so my interpretation was correct.\n\nIn summary, the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field, yielding an expected utility of $751M.\n\nActually, I'm a little perplexed at the optimal strategy. The cost of the test is $30M, and the value of the test is avoiding loss in the case of a Low-quality field. If we buy without testing, we get $30M in the Low-quality case, but if we test and get a \"Fail\" result, we would not buy, and get $350M. That seems like a big difference, and the test seems valuable. Let me reconsider this.\n\nLet's try working from another angle. Let's compare the utility of buying directly with the utility of taking the test and then making the optimal decision.\n\nFirst, what's the expected utility of directly buying the field without testing?\nE[U_buy_direct] = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.2 × $30M = $751M\n\nNext, what's the expected utility of taking the test and then making the optimal decision?\nWe figured out that we'd buy after a Pass and not buy after a Fail.\n\nE[U_test] = P(Pass) × E[U_buy|Pass] + P(Fail) × E[U_not_buy|Fail]\n         = 0.6775 × (0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M) + 0.3225 × $350M\n         = 0.6775 × $906.7M + 0.3225 × $350M\n         = $614.3M + $112.9M\n         = $727.2M\n\nSo again, we see that E[U_buy_direct] = $751M > E[U_test] = $727.2M, which means that the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the field.\n\nI think the confusion arises because the test costs a significant amount ($30M) and the prior probabilities already favor higher quality fields (High and Medium combined have 80% probability). The test provides some value in helping us avoid Low-quality fields, but the cost of the test outweighs this benefit in this particular scenario.\n\nHere's another way to look at it: Let's consider the unconditional expectation of the field's value (i.e. if we bought it without testing):\n\nE[Field Value] = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.2 × $30M = $751M\n\nNow, when we take the test, we might sometimes not buy the field (after a Fail result). Let's compute the probability that we avoid buying a Low-quality field due to the test:\n\nP(Low, Fail) = P(Low) × P(Fail|Low) = 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.17\n\nBut by not buying in all Fail cases (which happen with probability P(Fail) = 0.3225), we might also miss some High and Medium quality fields. Let's compute these probabilities:\n\nP(High, Fail) = P(High) × P(Fail|High) = 0.35 × 0.05 = 0.0175\nP(Medium, Fail) = P(Medium) × P(Fail|Medium) = 0.45 × 0.3 = 0.135\n\nSo the test helps us avoid investing in Low-quality fields with probability 0.17, but at the cost of missing High-quality fields with probability 0.0175 and Medium-quality fields with probability 0.135. The utility of the test depends on whether avoiding the Low-quality fields is worth the cost of missing some better fields and the cost of the test itself.\n\nThe reason why skipping the test and directly buying is optimal is that the opportunity cost of missing higher quality fields (due to false Fail results) and the cost of the test itself outweigh the benefit of avoiding investment in Low-quality fields.\n\nActually, I just realized I may have been doing the calculations incorrectly. Let me try once more. The key question is: when is the test worth the $30M cost?\n\nLet me regroup and reread the problem once more.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the utilities correctly:\n\nIf we test (paying $30M), and then decide to buy:\n- High-quality field: $1250M utility\n- Medium-quality field: $630M utility\n- Low-quality field: $0M utility\nIf we test (paying $30M), and decide not to buy:\n- $350M utility\n\nIf we do not test, and decide to buy:\n- High-quality field: $1280M utility\n- Medium-quality field: $660M utility\n- Low-quality field: $30M utility\nIf we do not test, and decide not to buy:\n- $380M utility\n\nI see that the utilities in both cases differ by exactly the cost of the test, $30M. This suggests that the utilities are net of any costs and benefits, and they represent the final payoff to the decision-maker in each scenario.\n\nGiven these utilities, let's first determine what the company would do if they didn't test, and then compare it to what they would do if they did test.\n\nIf they don't test, they have two options: buy or don't buy.\nExpected utility of buying without testing:\nE[U_buy_direct] = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.2 × $30M = $751M\n\nExpected utility of not buying without testing:\nE[U_not_buy_direct] = $380M\n\nSince $751M > $380M, they would buy the field if they didn't test.\n\nNow, let's see what they would do if they did test. \n\nFirst, let's compute the probabilities of each test result:\nP(Pass) = 0.35 × 0.95 + 0.45 × 0.7 + 0.2 × 0.15 = 0.6775\nP(Fail) = 1 - 0.6775 = 0.3225\n\nNext, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities:\n\nP(High|Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 = 0.3325 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491\nP(Medium|Pass) = (0.7 × 0.45) / 0.6775 = 0.315 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465\nP(Low|Pass) = (0.15 × 0.2) / 0.6775 = 0.03 / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044\n\nP(High|Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 = 0.0175 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054\nP(Medium|Fail) = (0.3 × 0.45) / 0.3225 = 0.135 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419\nP(Low|Fail) = (0.85 × 0.2) / 0.3225 = 0.17 / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527\n\nNow, let's compute the expected utility of each decision after observing the test result:\n\nExpected utility of buying after Pass:\nE[U_buy|Pass] = 0.491 × $1250M + 0.465 × $630M + 0.044 × $0M = $907M\n\nExpected utility of not buying after Pass:\nE[U_not_buy|Pass] = $350M\n\nSince $907M > $350M, they would buy the field after a Pass result.\n\nExpected utility of buying after Fail:\nE[U_buy|Fail] = 0.054 × $1250M + 0.419 × $630M + 0.527 × $0M = $331M\n\nExpected utility of not buying after Fail:\nE[U_not_buy|Fail] = $350M\n\nSince $331M < $350M, they would not buy the field after a Fail result.\n\nNow, let's compute the expected utility of testing, assuming they make the optimal decision after each test result:\n\nE[U_test] = P(Pass) × max{E[U_buy|Pass], E[U_not_buy|Pass]} + P(Fail) × max{E[U_buy|Fail], E[U_not_buy|Fail]}\nE[U_test] = 0.6775 × $907M + 0.3225 × $350M = $727M\n\nFinally, let's compare the expected utility of testing with the expected utility of buying directly without testing:\n\nE[U_buy_direct] = $751M\nE[U_test] = $727M\n\nSince $751M > $727M, the optimal decision is to skip the test and directly buy the field.\n\nI've been approaching this problem a bit mechanically rather than intuitively. Let's try to understand what's going on here. \n\nWhen we test, we're paying $30M for information that will help us decide whether to buy the field. But the test isn't perfect, so there's still some uncertainty. The key question is: is the test worth the $30M cost?\n\nLet's say the test costs $X. Then we're indifferent between testing and not testing when the expected utilities are equal:\n\nE[U_test] = E[U_buy_direct]\nP(Pass) × max{E[U_buy|Pass], E[U_not_buy|Pass]} + P(Fail) × max{E[U_buy|Fail], E[U_not_buy|Fail]} = E[U_buy_direct]\n\nLet's solve for $X.\n\nFirst, what's the expected utility of directly buying the field without testing, if the test costs $X?\nE[U_buy_direct] = 0.35 × $1280M + 0.45 × $660M + 0.2 × $30M = $751M\n\nNext, what's the expected utility of taking the test (costing $X) and then making the optimal decision?\nHmm actually in this case, the cost is already factored into the utility values. Let's say the cost of the test is $Y more than the current $30M. Then we have:\n\nE[U_test] = P(Pass) × max{E[U_buy|Pass] - $Y, E[U_not_buy|Pass] - $Y} + P(Fail) × max{E[U_buy|Fail] - $Y, E[U_not_buy|Fail] - $Y}\nE[U_test] = P(Pass) × (max{E[U_buy|Pass], E[U_not_buy|Pass]} - $Y) + P(Fail) × (max{E[U_buy|Fail], E[U_not_buy|Fail]} - $Y)\nE[U_test] = P(Pass) × max{E[U_buy|Pass], E[U_not_buy|Pass]} + P(Fail) × max{E[U_buy|Fail], E[U_not_buy|Fail]} - $Y\nE[U_test] = 0.6775 × $907M + 0.3225 × $350M - $Y = $727M - $Y\n\nAt what value of $Y are we indifferent between testing and not testing?\nE[U_test] = E[U_buy_direct]\n$727M - $Y = $751M\n-$Y = $24M\n$Y = -$24M\n\nSo if the test cost $24M less than it currently does (i.e. if it cost $6M instead of $30M), then we would be indifferent between testing and not testing. Since it currently costs $30M, we're $24M away from indifference, so we prefer not to test.\n\nActually, let me rethink this. The problem is that the utility values provided already account for the cost of the test. so I can't use the approach of solving for the test cost, since it's already included in the utility values. Let me go back to the original approach of comparing the expected utilities of each decision.\n\nBased on the utility values provided, we have:\nE[U_buy_direct] = $751M\nE[U_test] = $727M\n\nSince $751M > $727M, the optimal decision is to skip the test and directly buy the field.\n\nOK I have confidence in this conclusion now. Let's step back and provide a deep explanation of what's going on. \n\nThe key concept that explains our result is the expected value of information. In this context, this is the improvement in expected utility that results from having the test information, compared to not having it.\n\nWhen we don't test, the optimal decision is to buy, giving us an expected utility of $751M.\n\nWhen we test, we get to make a more informed decision, but at a cost of $30M. We would buy after a Pass result (probability 0.6775, yielding expected utility $907M) and not buy after a Fail result (probability 0.3225, yielding utility $350M), giving us an overall expected utility of $727M. \n\nSo the test costs us $30M, but how much does it improve our decision-making? Without testing, we would always buy, giving us $751M in expectation. With testing, we make a more nuanced decision, buying only after a Pass result, which gives us $727M in expectation. So on net, the test actually decreases our expected utility by $751M - $727M = $24M. This is why it's optimal to skip the test.\n\nWhy does the test reduce our expected utility? It's because the test is imperfect and there is a non-trivial cost to the test. The main benefit of the test is that it helps us avoid buying Low-quality fields, but there's a trade-off: we might also decide not to buy Medium and High quality fields (after a Fail result), and we have to pay for the test.\n\nGiven the prior probabilities (High: 35%, Medium: 45%, Low: 20%), and the reliability of the test, the expected utility of directly buying the field is higher than the expected utility of testing and then deciding whether to buy. This suggests that the value of the information provided by the test is less than its cost.\n\nIn summary, the optimal strategy is to skip the test and directly buy the oil field, yielding an expected utility of $751M.\n\nSo here's a summary of my analysis:\n\n1. The optimal decision without testing is to buy the oil field, with an expected utility of $751M.\n2. If we were to test, the optimal decision would be to buy after a Pass result and not buy after a Fail result, with an overall expected utility of $727M.\n3. Since $751M > $727M, it's optimal to skip the test and directly buy the oil field.\n\nBut there's a deeper economic insight here. The expected value of the information provided by the test (how much it improves our decision-making) is less than the cost of the test. This is because the test is imperfect and the prior probabilities already favor higher quality fields (80% for High and Medium combined)."
