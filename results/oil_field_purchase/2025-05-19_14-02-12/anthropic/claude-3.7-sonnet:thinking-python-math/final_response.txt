## Introduction
This problem requires us to determine whether to perform a porosity test before deciding to buy an oil field with uncertain quality. I'll analyze this decision using expected utility calculations.

## Decision Analysis Step-by-Step

### Expected Utility Without Testing

First, let's analyze the decision to buy the field without conducting any tests:

- **Buy without testing**:
  - P(High) = 0.35, Utility = $1280M
  - P(Medium) = 0.45, Utility = $660M
  - P(Low) = 0.20, Utility = $30M
  - **Expected Utility = $751M**

- **Don't buy without testing**:
  - Utility = $380M

Since $751M > $380M, if we don't conduct the test, we should buy the field.

### Test Result Probabilities

The probability of each test result:
- P(Pass) = 0.6775 (≈68%)
- P(Fail) = 0.3225 (≈32%)

### Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' rule, we can update our beliefs after observing each test result:

For a "Pass" result:
- P(High|Pass) = 0.4908 (≈49%)
- P(Medium|Pass) = 0.4649 (≈46%)
- P(Low|Pass) = 0.0443 (≈4%)

For a "Fail" result:
- P(High|Fail) = 0.0543 (≈5%)
- P(Medium|Fail) = 0.4186 (≈42%)
- P(Low|Fail) = 0.5271 (≈53%)

### Optimal Decisions After Testing

1. **After observing "Pass"**:
   - Buy: $906.4M
   - Don't Buy: $350M
   - Optimal decision: **Buy** (higher utility)

2. **After observing "Fail"**:
   - Buy: $331.6M
   - Don't Buy: $350M
   - Optimal decision: **Don't Buy** (higher utility)

### Overall Expected Utility of Testing

- Expected Utility with testing = P(Pass) × Utility(Best action|Pass) + P(Fail) × Utility(Best action|Fail)
- = 0.6775 × $906.4M + 0.3225 × $350M
- = $726.9M

### Comparison and Final Recommendation

- Expected utility of buying without testing: **$751M**
- Expected utility of performing the test: **$726.9M**

Since $751M > $726.9M, the optimal strategy is to **skip the test and directly buy the oil field**.

## Economic Interpretation

While the test provides valuable information that helps avoid buying low-quality fields, the cost of the test ($30M) and the possibility of missing profitable opportunities outweigh its benefits. The test would tell us to reject the field when we observe a "Fail" result, but given the prior probabilities and utilities, this isn't worth the test cost.

Some key insights:
1. The prior probability of having at least a medium-quality field is high (80%)
2. Even low-quality fields have some value ($30M without testing)
3. The $30M test cost reduces all utilities in the testing scenario
4. The test is imperfect - it can incorrectly identify high-quality fields as failures and low-quality fields as passes

## Conclusion

**Optimal Decision Strategy**: Skip the porosity test and directly buy the oil field.
**Expected Utility**: $751M

This decision maximizes expected monetary value given the available information and costs.
