    "content": "## Oil Field Investment Decision Problem  \n\n### Problem Overview  \nAn oil company must decide whether to **buy (B)** an oil field whose true quality **Q** is uncertain.  \n\nQ has three possible states:\n- **High**: Exceptional reserves, high-profit potential  \n- **Medium**: Moderate reserves, acceptable profit  \n- **Low**: Poor reserves, high financial risk  \n\nHistorical and survey data give the prior probabilities:\n- P(Q = High) = 0.35  \n- P(Q = Medium) = 0.45\n- P(Q = Low)   = 0.20  \n\n### Information-Gathering Option  \nThe company may optionally perform a **Porosity Test** at cost \\$30M (i.e.\\ \\$30 million):  \n- **Result R = “Pass”** if porosity ≥ 15%  \n- **Result R = “Fail”** if porosity < 15%  \n- Or skip testing and go straight to the purchase decision.\n\n#### Test Reliability \n\nThe test provides imperfect but valuable information about the true quality of the field. We can represent the reliability of the test as a conditional probability distribution P(R | Q) where:\n\n**High Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|high) = 0.95 → Strong indicator of quality  \n- P(Fail|high) = 0.05 → Rare false negative  \n\n**Medium Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|medium) = 0.7 → Moderate correlation  \n- P(Fail|medium) = 0.3  \n\n**Low Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|low) = 0.15 → Rare false positive  \n- P(Fail|low) = 0.85 → Strong indicator of poor quality  \n\n### Outcome Utilities  \nTo evaluate the decision problem, we need to define the value (utility) of each outcome. This utility reflects the desirability of a particular scenario (buying the field after a successful test, etc.).\n\n#### If Test Performed  \n- **Buy (after observing R):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1250M\n  - Q = Medium → +\\$630M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$0M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$350M  \n\n*(Note: test cost \\$30M is already subtracted from all of these figures.)*\n\n#### If No Test  \n- **Buy (direct):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1280M  \n  - Q = Medium → +\\$660M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$30M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$380M  \n\n### Decision Sequence  \n1. Decide whether to perform the Porosity Test.  \n2. If tested, observe result R.  \n3. Decide whether to buy the oil field.  \n\n## Objective\n\nGiven the problem description above, your task is to identify the rational decision(s) at each point in the process. Use the information provided to evaluate the options and explain your reasoning clearly. Return your final recommendation based on sound analysis.\n"

Calculate Expected Utilities and Decisions after Test Results:**\n\n*   **If Test Result is \"Pass\" (R=Pass):**\n    *   **EU(B | Pass, T):**\n        EU(B | Pass, T) = P(High|Pass)U(B,High|T) + P(Medium|Pass)U(B,Medium|T) + P(Low|Pass)U(B,Low|T)\n        EU(B | Pass, T) = (0.49077 * 1250) + (0.46494 * 630) + (0.04428 * 0)\n        EU(B | Pass, T) = 613.4625 + 292.9122 + 0\n        EU(B | Pass, T) ≈ $906.37M\n    *   **EU(DB | Pass, T):**\n        EU(DB | Pass, T) = U(DB | T) = $350M\n    *   **Decision if Pass:** Since EU(B | Pass, T) = $906.37M > EU(DB | Pass, T) = $350M, if the test result is \"Pass\", the company should **Buy**.\n        The value of this path (observing \"Pass\") is $906.37M.\n\n*   **If Test Result is \"Fail\" (R=Fail):**\n    *   **EU(B | Fail, T):**\n        EU(B | Fail, T) = P(High|Fail)U(B,High|T) + P(Medium|Fail)U(B,Medium|T) + P(Low|Fail)U(B,Low|T)\n        EU(B | Fail, T) = (0.05426 * 1250) + (0.41860 * 630) + (0.52713 * 0)\n        EU(B | Fail, T) = 67.825 + 263.718 + 0\n        EU(B | Fail, T) ≈ $331.54M\n    *   **EU(DB | Fail, T):**\n        EU(DB | Fail, T) = U(DB | T) = $350M\n    *   **Decision if Fail:** Since EU(DB | Fail, T) = $350M > EU(B | Fail, T) = $331.54M, if the test result is \"Fail\", the company should **Not Buy**.\n        The value of this path (observing \"Fail\") is $350M.\n\n**2d. Calculate Overall Expected Utility of Performing the Test, EU(T):**\nEU(T) = P(Pass) * EU(Optimal Action | Pass) + P(Fail) * EU(Optimal Action | Fail)\nEU(T) = (0.6775 * 906.3747) + (0.3225 * 350)\nEU(T) = 614.0699 + 112.875\nEU(T) ≈ $726.94M\n*(Note: The test cost of $30M is already incorporated into the utilities for the \"If Test Performed\" scenarios, as stated in the problem. So EU(T) is the net expected utility of testing.)*\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision: Test or No Test?\n\nNow we compare the expected utility of the \"Test\" branch with the \"No Test\" branch.\n*   EU(NT) = $751M\n*   EU(T) = $726.94M\n\nSince EU(NT) > EU(T), the company should **Not Perform the Porosity Test**.\n\n### Summary of Rational Decisions and Recommendation:\n\n1.  **Initial Decision (Perform Test vs. No Test):**\n    *   The expected utility of not performing the test is EU(NT) = $751M.\n    *   The expected utility of performing the test (and then acting optimally) is EU(T) = $726.94M.\n    *   **Decision:** Choose **No Test** because $751M > $726.94M.\n\n2.  **Subsequent Decision (If No Test is chosen):**\n    *   If No Test is chosen, the decision is between Buy and Not Buy.\n    *   EU(Buy | No Test) = $751M\n    *   EU(Don't Buy | No Test) = $380M\n    *   **Decision:** Choose to **Buy** the oil field.\n\n3.  **(For completeness) Subsequent Decisions (If Test were chosen, even though it's not optimal):**\n    *   If Test were performed and result is \"Pass\": **Buy** the field (EU $906.37M vs $350M).\n    *   If Test were performed and result is \"Fail\": **Do Not Buy** the field (EU $350M vs $331.54M).\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nThe optimal strategy for the oil company is to **not perform the Porosity Test** and proceed directly to **buy the oil field**. This strategy has the highest overall expected utility of **$751 million**.\n\nEven though the test provides information, its cost (implicitly included by reducing payoffs in the \"test\" branches) and the decision landscape make it slightly less valuable than making an immediate decision based on prior probabilities. Specifically, the information from a \"Fail\" result would lead to not buying (utility $350M after test cost), which is still a reasonable outcome. However, the chance of a \"Pass\" leading to a buy, combined with the chance of a \"Fail\" leading to not buying, doesn't outweigh the expected utility of simply buying without the test. If we were to calculate the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) or Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI) for this test, the EVSI would be less than the test cost of $30M, which is consistent with our finding (EU(T) is $726.94M, while EU(NT) is $751M, a difference of $24.06M. This difference is effectively $30M - EVSI_gross, meaning EVSI_gross = $5.94M, which is less than the $30M cost).",
