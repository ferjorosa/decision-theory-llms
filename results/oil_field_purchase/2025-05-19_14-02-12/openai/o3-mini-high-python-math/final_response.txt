Below is a clear analysis of the decision problem:

──────────────────────────────
1. Prior Probabilities and Payoffs

The oil field quality Q has three states:
 • High: P = 0.35  
 • Medium: P = 0.45  
 • Low: P = 0.20

There are two branches:
 A. Skip the Porosity Test (“No Test”)  
 B. Conduct the Test (“Test”)

Payoffs differ by branch:

• Without Test (direct decision):
 – If Buy:
  ◦ High: +\$1280M  
  ◦ Medium: +\$660M  
  ◦ Low: +\$30M  
 – If Do Not Buy: +\$380M

• With Test (test cost \$30M is already deducted):
 – If Buy:
  ◦ High: +\$1250M  
  ◦ Medium: +\$630M  
  ◦ Low: +\$0M  
 – If Do Not Buy: +\$350M

──────────────────────────────
2. No-Test Branch Analysis

Since not buying directly yields \$380M, we compare that with buying.

Expected value if buying directly:
 EV(buy) = (0.35 × 1280) + (0.45 × 660) + (0.20 × 30)
     = 448 + 297 + 6 
     = 751 (in millions)

Thus, for the no-test branch, buying gives an expected value (EV) of \$751M.

──────────────────────────────
3. Test Branch Analysis

The test is imperfect. Its reliability:
 • For High: P(Pass|High) = 0.95, P(Fail|High) = 0.05  
 • For Medium: P(Pass|Medium) = 0.70, P(Fail|Medium) = 0.30  
 • For Low: P(Pass|Low) = 0.15, P(Fail|Low) = 0.85  

First, compute the overall probability for each test result:

 P(Pass) = (0.35 × 0.95) + (0.45 × 0.70) + (0.20 × 0.15)
     = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03 
     = 0.6775

 P(Fail) = 1 − 0.6775 = 0.3225

Using Bayes’ rule, update the probabilities:

• If R = Pass:
 – P(High|Pass) = (0.35 × 0.95) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491  
 – P(Medium|Pass) = (0.45 × 0.70) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465  
 – P(Low|Pass) = (0.20 × 0.15) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044  

• If R = Fail:
 – P(High|Fail) = (0.35 × 0.05) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054  
 – P(Medium|Fail) = (0.45 × 0.30) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419  
 – P(Low|Fail) = (0.20 × 0.85) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527  

Now, consider decisions after obtaining the test result:

──────────────────────────────
Step 3A: After a “Pass” Result

If buying:
 EV(buy | Pass) = (0.491 × 1250) + (0.465 × 630) + (0.044 × 0)
         ≈ 613.75 + 292.95 
         ≈ 906.7

Not buying yields +350M. Since 906.7 > 350, the optimal decision when the test passes is to buy.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3B: After a “Fail” Result

If buying:
 EV(buy | Fail) = (0.054 × 1250) + (0.419 × 630) + (0.527 × 0)
         ≈ 67.5 + 263.97 
         ≈ 331.5

Not buying yields +350M, which is higher than 331.5. Thus, if the test fails, the company should not buy.

──────────────────────────────
4. Overall Expected Value with Testing

Combine the branches using the test result probabilities:
 EV(Test) = P(Pass) × (optimal EV given Pass) + P(Fail) × (optimal EV given Fail)
      = (0.6775 × 906.7) + (0.3225 × 350)
      ≈ 614.2 + 112.9
      ≈ 727.1 (in millions)

──────────────────────────────
5. Decision Comparison and Recommendation

• No Test (direct buy) yields EV ≈ \$751M.  
• Test branch (with subsequent decisions) yields EV ≈ \$727M.

Since \$751M > \$727M, the expected payoff is higher when the company skips the test and directly buys the oil field.

──────────────────────────────
Final Recommendation

The company should:
 1. Do NOT perform the porosity test.
 2. Directly purchase the oil field.

This strategy maximizes expected utility.
