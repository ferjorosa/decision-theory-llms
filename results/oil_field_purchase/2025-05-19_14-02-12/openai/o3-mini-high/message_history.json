    "content": "## Oil Field Investment Decision Problem  \n\n### Problem Overview  \nAn oil company must decide whether to **buy (B)** an oil field whose true quality **Q** is uncertain.  \n\nQ has three possible states:\n- **High**: Exceptional reserves, high-profit potential  \n- **Medium**: Moderate reserves, acceptable profit  \n- **Low**: Poor reserves, high financial risk  \n\nHistorical and survey data give the prior probabilities:\n- P(Q = High) = 0.35  \n- P(Q = Medium) = 0.45\n- P(Q = Low)   = 0.20  \n\n### Information-Gathering Option  \nThe company may optionally perform a **Porosity Test** at cost \\$30M (i.e.\\ \\$30 million):  \n- **Result R = “Pass”** if porosity ≥ 15%  \n- **Result R = “Fail”** if porosity < 15%  \n- Or skip testing and go straight to the purchase decision.\n\n#### Test Reliability \n\nThe test provides imperfect but valuable information about the true quality of the field. We can represent the reliability of the test as a conditional probability distribution P(R | Q) where:\n\n**High Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|high) = 0.95 → Strong indicator of quality  \n- P(Fail|high) = 0.05 → Rare false negative  \n\n**Medium Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|medium) = 0.7 → Moderate correlation  \n- P(Fail|medium) = 0.3  \n\n**Low Quality Fields:**  \n- P(Pass|low) = 0.15 → Rare false positive  \n- P(Fail|low) = 0.85 → Strong indicator of poor quality  \n\n### Outcome Utilities  \nTo evaluate the decision problem, we need to define the value (utility) of each outcome. This utility reflects the desirability of a particular scenario (buying the field after a successful test, etc.).\n\n#### If Test Performed  \n- **Buy (after observing R):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1250M\n  - Q = Medium → +\\$630M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$0M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$350M  \n\n*(Note: test cost \\$30M is already subtracted from all of these figures.)*\n\n#### If No Test  \n- **Buy (direct):**  \n  - Q = High → +\\$1280M  \n  - Q = Medium → +\\$660M  \n  - Q = Low → +\\$30M  \n- **Do Not Buy:** +\\$380M  \n\n### Decision Sequence  \n1. Decide whether to perform the Porosity Test.  \n2. If tested, observe result R.  \n3. Decide whether to buy the oil field.  \n\n## Objective\n\nGiven the problem description above, your task is to identify the rational decision(s) at each point in the process. Use the information provided to evaluate the options and explain your reasoning clearly. Return your final recommendation based on sound analysis.\n"

    "content": "Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the decision problem.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Prior Probabilities and Outcomes\n\nThe quality Q of the oil field can be:\n • High with probability 0.35  \n • Medium with probability 0.45  \n • Low with probability 0.20\n\nThere are two “branches” to consider:\n A. No Test (skip testing)  \n B. Test (perform the porosity test at a cost of US$30M)\n\nFor each branch, the oil company will then decide whether to buy the field or not.\n──────────────────────────────\n2. No-Test Branch\n\nIf the company skips the test, the purchase decision is made under the original probabilities. The net outcomes (in millions) are:\n\n • If Buy:\n  – Q = High: +1250 +30M compared to tested outcomes becomes +1280M without test  \n  – Q = Medium: +660M  \n  – Q = Low: +30M  \n • If Not Buy: +380M\n\nLet’s calculate the expected value (EV) if the company decides to buy:\n EV(buy) = (0.35 × 1280) + (0.45 × 660) + (0.20 × 30)\n\n  = 448 + 297 + 6  \n  = 751 (in millions)\n\nSince not buying yields only 380, buying is clearly preferred.\n So, EV(No Test) = 751M if the company skips the test and buys the field.\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Test Branch\n\nIf the company conducts the porosity test (cost already factored into the payoffs), the outcomes change as follows:\n\nTest reliability is given by:\n • For High quality: P(Pass | High) = 0.95, P(Fail | High) = 0.05  \n • For Medium quality: P(Pass | Medium) = 0.70, P(Fail | Medium) = 0.30  \n • For Low quality: P(Pass | Low) = 0.15, P(Fail | Low) = 0.85  \n\nFirst, compute the overall probabilities of Pass and Fail:\n\n P(Pass) = (0.35 × 0.95) + (0.45 × 0.70) + (0.20 × 0.15)\n      = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03\n      = 0.6775\n\n P(Fail) = 1 – 0.6775 = 0.3225\n\nThen, update the probabilities by Bayes’ rule:\n\n• For a \"Pass\" result:\n – P(High | Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491  \n – P(Medium | Pass) = (0.70 × 0.45) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465  \n – P(Low | Pass) = (0.15 × 0.20) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044  \n\n• For a \"Fail\" result:\n – P(High | Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054  \n – P(Medium | Fail) = (0.30 × 0.45) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419  \n – P(Low | Fail) = (0.85 × 0.20) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527  \n\nNext, review the available payoffs (cost of test already deducted):\n\nIf the company buys after testing:\n • Q = High: +1250  \n • Q = Medium: +630  \n • Q = Low: +0\n\nIf the company does not buy after testing, the payoff is +350.\n\nNow, decide the optimal action for each test outcome:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3A: Decision after a \"Pass\" Result\n\nIf Pass is observed, the expected payoff from buying is:\n EV(buy | Pass) = (0.491 × 1250) + (0.465 × 630) + (0.044 × 0)\n          ≈ 613.75 + 292.95 + 0\n          ≈ 906.7\n\nIf the company does not buy, it gets 350. Since 906.7 > 350, the optimal decision is to BUY when the test is Pass.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3B: Decision after a \"Fail\" Result\n\nIf Fail is observed, the expected payoff from buying is:\n EV(buy | Fail) = (0.054 × 1250) + (0.419 × 630) + (0.527 × 0)\n          ≈ 67.5 + 263.97 + 0\n          ≈ 331.5\n\nNot buying yields 350. Since 350 > 331.5, the optimal decision after a Fail is to NOT BUY.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nOverall EV if Test is Performed\n\nNow, combine the two branches using the probabilities for Pass and Fail:\n EV(Test) = P(Pass) × (EV given Pass) + P(Fail) × (EV given Fail)\n      = (0.6775 × 906.7) + (0.3225 × 350)\n      ≈ 614.2 + 112.9\n      ≈ 727.1M\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Comparison and Final Recommendation\n\n• No-Test Branch (direct buy): EV ≈ 751M  \n• Test Branch (optimal decisions after observing result): EV ≈ 727M\n\nSince 751M > 727M, the expected value is higher if the company skips the test and simply buys the oil field.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Rational Strategy\n\n1. Do NOT perform the porosity test.\n2. Directly purchase the oil field.\n\nThis decision maximizes expected utility, as the cost and imperfect information from the test reduce the overall expected payoff.",
