Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the decision problem.

──────────────────────────────
1. Prior Probabilities and Outcomes

The quality Q of the oil field can be:
 • High with probability 0.35  
 • Medium with probability 0.45  
 • Low with probability 0.20

There are two “branches” to consider:
 A. No Test (skip testing)  
 B. Test (perform the porosity test at a cost of US$30M)

For each branch, the oil company will then decide whether to buy the field or not.
──────────────────────────────
2. No-Test Branch

If the company skips the test, the purchase decision is made under the original probabilities. The net outcomes (in millions) are:

 • If Buy:
  – Q = High: +1250 +30M compared to tested outcomes becomes +1280M without test  
  – Q = Medium: +660M  
  – Q = Low: +30M  
 • If Not Buy: +380M

Let’s calculate the expected value (EV) if the company decides to buy:
 EV(buy) = (0.35 × 1280) + (0.45 × 660) + (0.20 × 30)

  = 448 + 297 + 6  
  = 751 (in millions)

Since not buying yields only 380, buying is clearly preferred.
 So, EV(No Test) = 751M if the company skips the test and buys the field.
──────────────────────────────
3. Test Branch

If the company conducts the porosity test (cost already factored into the payoffs), the outcomes change as follows:

Test reliability is given by:
 • For High quality: P(Pass | High) = 0.95, P(Fail | High) = 0.05  
 • For Medium quality: P(Pass | Medium) = 0.70, P(Fail | Medium) = 0.30  
 • For Low quality: P(Pass | Low) = 0.15, P(Fail | Low) = 0.85  

First, compute the overall probabilities of Pass and Fail:

 P(Pass) = (0.35 × 0.95) + (0.45 × 0.70) + (0.20 × 0.15)
      = 0.3325 + 0.315 + 0.03
      = 0.6775

 P(Fail) = 1 – 0.6775 = 0.3225

Then, update the probabilities by Bayes’ rule:

• For a "Pass" result:
 – P(High | Pass) = (0.95 × 0.35) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.491  
 – P(Medium | Pass) = (0.70 × 0.45) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.465  
 – P(Low | Pass) = (0.15 × 0.20) / 0.6775 ≈ 0.044  

• For a "Fail" result:
 – P(High | Fail) = (0.05 × 0.35) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.054  
 – P(Medium | Fail) = (0.30 × 0.45) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.419  
 – P(Low | Fail) = (0.85 × 0.20) / 0.3225 ≈ 0.527  

Next, review the available payoffs (cost of test already deducted):

If the company buys after testing:
 • Q = High: +1250  
 • Q = Medium: +630  
 • Q = Low: +0

If the company does not buy after testing, the payoff is +350.

Now, decide the optimal action for each test outcome:

──────────────────────────────
Step 3A: Decision after a "Pass" Result

If Pass is observed, the expected payoff from buying is:
 EV(buy | Pass) = (0.491 × 1250) + (0.465 × 630) + (0.044 × 0)
          ≈ 613.75 + 292.95 + 0
          ≈ 906.7

If the company does not buy, it gets 350. Since 906.7 > 350, the optimal decision is to BUY when the test is Pass.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3B: Decision after a "Fail" Result

If Fail is observed, the expected payoff from buying is:
 EV(buy | Fail) = (0.054 × 1250) + (0.419 × 630) + (0.527 × 0)
          ≈ 67.5 + 263.97 + 0
          ≈ 331.5

Not buying yields 350. Since 350 > 331.5, the optimal decision after a Fail is to NOT BUY.

──────────────────────────────
Overall EV if Test is Performed

Now, combine the two branches using the probabilities for Pass and Fail:
 EV(Test) = P(Pass) × (EV given Pass) + P(Fail) × (EV given Fail)
      = (0.6775 × 906.7) + (0.3225 × 350)
      ≈ 614.2 + 112.9
      ≈ 727.1M

──────────────────────────────
4. Comparison and Final Recommendation

• No-Test Branch (direct buy): EV ≈ 751M  
• Test Branch (optimal decisions after observing result): EV ≈ 727M

Since 751M > 727M, the expected value is higher if the company skips the test and simply buys the oil field.

──────────────────────────────
Final Rational Strategy

1. Do NOT perform the porosity test.
2. Directly purchase the oil field.

This decision maximizes expected utility, as the cost and imperfect information from the test reduce the overall expected payoff.
