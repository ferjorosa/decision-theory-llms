# Decision Theory Problems

This directory contains a collection of decision theory problems. Every problem is structured within its own folder, containing a `README.md` file with a brief explanation and a Jupyter notebook with a detailed problem description and implementation. The implementations use influence diagrams, also known as decision networks ([Howard and Matheson, 1984](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1983-howard-readingsondecisionanalysis-v1.pdf)), with the Python library [PyAgrum](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/).


> **TODO:** Currently, the problems are fully structured with properly identified variables and probability tables. In a real-world scenario, a preliminary analysis step would typically be required to structure the decision problem, enabling it to be more easily transformed into a decision tree or influence diagram.
