    "An oil company is considering the <span style=\"color: red\"><b>decision</b></span> (<span style=\"color: red\"><b>B</b></span>) to buy an oil field. The oil field can have three quality levels (<span style=\"color: purple\"><b>Q</b></span>): high ($q_1$), medium ($q_2$), and low ($q_3$). The company obviously does not know the \"real\" qaulity of the field beforehand, but it can provide an estimation (i.e., <span style=\"color: purple\"><b>uncertainty</b></span> ) using historical data and imagery. **It is willing to pay a higher price for the field as its quality increases**.\n",

    "Before making the buy decision, the company needs to <span style=\"color: red\"><b>decide</b></span> (<span style=\"color: red\"><b>T</b></span>) if it wants to perform a geological test. This test will have a certain cost and its results (<span style=\"color: purple\"><b>R</b></span>) will not be exact predictions about the quality of the field, but will provide a report on the porosity of the reservoir (high porosity generally indicates greater oil potential). The test will not be infallible, and thus contain a certain degree of <span style=\"color: purple\"><b>uncertainty</b></span>. The test can have two possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
