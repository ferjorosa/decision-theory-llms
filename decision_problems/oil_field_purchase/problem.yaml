  ## Oil Field Investment Decision Problem  

  ### Problem Overview  
  An oil company must decide whether to **buy (B)** an oil field whose true quality **Q** is uncertain.  
  
  Q has three possible states:
  - **High**: Exceptional reserves, high-profit potential  
  - **Medium**: Moderate reserves, acceptable profit  
  - **Low**: Poor reserves, high financial risk  

  Historical and survey data give the prior probabilities:
  - P(Q = High) = 0.30  
  - P(Q = Medium) = 0.40  
  - P(Q = Low)   = 0.30  

  ### Information-Gathering Option  
  The company may optionally perform a **Porosity Test** at cost \$0.01 B (i.e.\ \$10 million):  
  - **Result R = “Pass”** if porosity ≥ 15%  
  - **Result R = “Fail”** if porosity < 15%  
  - Or skip testing and go straight to the purchase decision.

  #### Test Reliability 

  The test provides imperfect but valuable information about the true quality of the field. We can represent the reliability of the test as a conditional probability distribution P(R | Q) where:

  **High Quality Fields:**  
  - P(Pass|high) = 0.90 → Strong indicator of quality  
  - P(Fail|high) = 0.10 → Rare false negative  

  **Medium Quality Fields:**  
  - P(Pass|medium) = 0.65 → Moderate correlation  
  - P(Fail|medium) = 0.35  

  **Low Quality Fields:**  
  - P(Pass|low) = 0.15 → Rare false positive  
  - P(Fail|low) = 0.85 → Strong indicator of poor quality  

  ### Outcome Utilities  
  To evaluate the decision problem, we need to define the value (utility) of each outcome. This utility reflects the desirability of a particular scenario (buying the field after a successful test, etc.).

  #### If Test Performed  
  - **Buy (after observing R):**  
    - Q = High → +\$0.85 B  
    - Q = Medium → +\$0.43 B  
    - Q = Low → +\$0.00 B  
  - **Do Not Buy:** +\$0.25 B  

  *(Note: test cost \$0.01 B is already subtracted from all of these figures.)*

  #### If No Test  
  - **Buy (direct):**  
    - Q = High → +\$0.86 B  
    - Q = Medium → +\$0.44 B  
    - Q = Low → +\$0.01 B  
  - **Do Not Buy:** +\$0.26 B  

  ### Decision Sequence  
  1. Decide whether to perform the Porosity Test.  
  2. If tested, observe result R.  
  3. Decide whether to buy the oil field.
