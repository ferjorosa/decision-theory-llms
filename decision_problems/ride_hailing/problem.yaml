  ## Ride-Hailing Customer Retention Decision Problem
  A ride-hailing company must decide whether to make a special offer to existing subscribers to improve customer retention. Customers differ in their type: they are either 'Good' or 'Bad', and this affects how profitable they are when retained.

  ### Customer Types:
  - Good customers use the service often and are profitable.
  - Bad customers use the service infrequently and cost more than they bring in.

  Prior Probabilities:
  - The probability that a customer is Good is 0.9.
  - The probability that a customer is Bad is 0.1.

  ### Retention Probabilities:
  If the company makes an offer:
  - A Good customer stays with probability 0.85 and leaves with probability 0.15.
  - A Bad customer stays with probability 0.90 and leaves with probability 0.10.

  If the company does not make an offer:
  - A Good customer stays with probability 0.75 and leaves with probability 0.25.
  - A Bad customer stays with probability 0.15 and leaves with probability 0.85.

  ### Utilities (in euros) for different outcomes
  - If a Good customer stays: +100
  - If a Bad customer stays: -850
  - If any customer leaves: 0

  The cost of making the offer is considered negligible. The companyâ€™s utility only changes based on which customers are retained.

  ### Decision Sequence
  1. The company decides whether to make a special offer.
  2. The customer decides to stay or leave based on their type and the presence of an offer.
  3. The company receives utility based on whether the customer stayed and their type.
