  ## Logistics Center Automation Decision Problem

  ### Decision Context

  An e-commerce company is considering upgrading its logistics center with robotic automation. The company has three strategic options:

  1. **Conventional Robotics System**: This offers moderate automation and proven reliability.
  2. **Advanced Robotics System**: This system is highly automated and AI-powered, but it carries greater technical risk.
  3. **Do Nothing**: The current logistics system is retained with no investment.

  ### Optional Feasibility Test

  Before committing to the advanced system, the company may choose to conduct a feasibility test on critical system components. The test costs €10 million and yields one of three results: **bad (b)**, **good (g)**, or **excellent (e)**.

  The test outcome depends on the true performance category of the advanced system:

  - If the system is fully functional (smooth):
    - Probability of a good result: 0.20
    - Probability of an excellent result: 0.80

  - If the system is prone to minor failures:
    - Probability of a bad result: 0.30
    - Probability of a good result: 0.55
    - Probability of an excellent result: 0.15

  - If the system is prone to major failures:
    - Probability of a bad result: 0.40
    - Probability of a good result: 0.40
    - Probability of an excellent result: 0.20

  ### Prior Probabilities

  For the **advanced system**, the prior probabilities for each possible state are as follows:

  - Smooth operation: 0.70
  - Minor failure: 0.20
  - Major failure: 0.10

  For the **conventional system**, the prior probabilities are:

  - Smooth operation: 0.95
  - Failure: 0.05

  ### Outcome Utilities

  Utility is expressed in millions of euros and reflects the net value of each scenario.

  #### Utility Notation

  - **T**: Testing strategy (either `test`, `no test`, or `do nothing`)
  - **I**: Investment decision (`advanced` or `conventional`)
  - **A**: Outcome for the advanced system (`smooth`, `minor failure`, or `major failure`)
  - **C**: Outcome for the conventional system (`smooth` or `failure`)
  - **U**: Utility in € million

  #### Utility Values

  If the company **conducts the test** and then selects the **advanced system**, the utility values (after subtracting the €10M test cost) are:

  - Smooth operation: 140
  - Minor failure: -50
  - Major failure: -130

  If the company **conducts the test** and then selects the **conventional system**, the utility values are:

  - Smooth operation: 50
  - Failure: -40

  If the company **does not conduct the test** and chooses the **advanced system**, the utility values are:

  - Smooth operation: 150
  - Minor failure: -40
  - Major failure: -120

  If the company **does not conduct the test** and chooses the **conventional system**, the utility values are:

  - Smooth operation: 60
  - Failure: -30

  ### Decision Sequence

  The company follows this decision sequence:

  1. Choose whether to conduct the feasibility test.
  2. If the test is conducted, observe the test result (bad, good, or excellent).
  3. Update beliefs (posterior probabilities) based on the test result.
  4. Choose the investment strategy that maximizes expected utility.

  ## Logistics Center Automation Decision Problem

  ### Decision Context

  An e-commerce company is evaluating whether to upgrade its logistics center using **robotic automation**. The company has **three strategic options**:

  1. **Conventional Robotics System** - moderate automation, proven reliability  
  2. **Advanced Robotics System** - highly automated, AI-powered, but riskier  
  3. **Do Nothing** - retain the current system  

  ### Optional Feasibility Test

  To reduce uncertainty before committing to the advanced system, the company can conduct a **feasibility test** on critical components. The test costs **€10 million** and provides insight into the likelihood of system success or failure. Test results fall into three categories: *bad (b), good (g), or excellent (e).*  
  
  The probability of each test result depends on the actual performance state of the advanced system:  

  - **If the system is fully functional (success):**  
    - P(g | success) = 0.20  
    - P(e | success) = 0.80  
  - **If minor failures are likely:**  
    - P(b | minor failure) = 0.30  
    - P(g | minor failure) = 0.55  
    - P(e | minor failure) = 0.15  
  - **If major failures are likely:**  
    - P(b | major failure) = 0.40  
    - P(g | major failure) = 0.40  
    - P(e | major failure) = 0.20  

  ### Prior Probabilities

  **Advanced System:**

  | Outcome        | Probability |
  |----------------|-------------|
  | Smooth         | 0.70        |
  | Minor Failure  | 0.20        |
  | Major Failure  | 0.10        |

  **Conventional System:**

  | Outcome        | Probability |
  |----------------|-------------|
  | Smooth         | 0.95        |
  | Failure        | 0.05        |

  ### Outcome Utilities  

  To evaluate the decision problem, we define the utility of each outcome. Utility reflects the desirability or value of a given scenario, expressed in millions of euros.

  #### Utility Notation
  - **T**: Testing strategy (`test`, `no test`, or `do nothing`)  
  - **I**: Investment choice (`advanced`, `conventional`)  
  - **A**: Advanced system outcome (`smooth`, `minor`, `major`)  
  - **C**: Conventional system outcome (`smooth`, `failure`)  
  - **U**: Utility (in € million)  

  #### Utility Values by Scenario

  **Test → Advanced** (post-test values reflect the €10M test cost):

  | Advanced Outcome | Utility (U) |
  |------------------|-------------|
  | Smooth           | 140         |
  | Minor Failure    | -50         |
  | Major Failure    | -130        |

  **Test → Conventional**:

  | C Outcome   | Utility (U) |
  |-------------|-------------|
  | Smooth      | 50          |
  | Failure     | -40         |

  **No Test → Advanced**:

  | Advanced Outcome | Utility (U) |
  |------------------|-------------|
  | Smooth           | 150         |
  | Minor Failure    | -40         |
  | Major Failure    | -120        |

  **No Test → Conventional**:

  | C Outcome   | Utility (U) |
  |-------------|-------------|
  | Smooth      | 60          |
  | Failure     | -30         |

  ### Decision Sequence

  1. Decide whether to conduct the feasibility test.  
  2. If testing, observe the test result.  
  3. Update beliefs (posterior probabilities) based on the test result.  
  4. Choose the strategy that maximizes expected utility.
